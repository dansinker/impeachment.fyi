  yesterday: Yesterday, the House of Representatives introduced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/11/us/articles-impeachment-trump.html">articles of impeachment</a> against President Trump for "incitement of insurrection." The charge stems from last Wednesday, January 6, when the president's supporters <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2021/video-timeline-capitol-breach/">laid siege</a> to the Capitol after a speech where he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/us/politics/trump-speech-capitol.html">implored them to show "boldness" and "strength"</a> against what he claimed was a stolen election. The attack on the Capitol left <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/11/us/who-died-in-capitol-building-attack.html">five people dead</a>, including a Capitol Police officer and immediately lead to <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2021/01/08/alaska-sen-lisa-murkowski-calls-on-president-trump-to-resign-questions-her-future-as-a-republican/">calls for the president's resignation</a>. He hasn't, and so the House of Representatives moved into a high-speed impeachment with yesterday's introduction of articles. 
  todays:
  - item: After an evening of floor debate—some of which was devoted to complaints from Republicans about newly-installed metal detectors and mask fines—<b>the House of Representatives voted on a resolution calling on Vice President Mike Pence and Trump's Cabinet to remove President Trump from office. The final vote passed 223 to 205 with every Democrat voting for the resolution and all but one Republican, Illinois Representative Adam Kinzinger, voting against it.</b> The resolution is non-binding, so it was not likely to actually lead to the President's removal from office, but it was the first step the House was taking to hold the president accountable for his actions during last Wednesday's attack on the Capitol.

  - item: However, just before tonight's vote got underway, <b>Vice President Mike Pence wrote a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi informing her that he would <i>not</i> invoke the 25th</b>, rendering tonight's vote essentially meaningless. He quoted the bible—<i>stares</i>—in giving his reasoning, saying that "for everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven" and that now was a "time to heal." He urged "every member of Congress" to "avoid actions that would further divide and inflame the passions of the moment." A week ago tomorrow, the Vice President was locked down in an undisclosed location while armed insurrectionists roamed the halls of Congress calling his name. During that time, the president he protected tonight never phoned to find out if he was OK.

  - item: <b>Tonight's vote was really about setting up <i>tomorrow's</i> vote, which is on the one article of impeachment introduced <i>just yesterday</i>&#58; "Incitement of Insurrection."</b> If this feels much faster than—<i>checks notes</i>—last year's impeachment, that's because it is. The House has done away with the extensive inquiry and hearings they undertook last year and instead are charging straight to an impeachment vote in the final week of the Trump presidency. They will gavel in tomorrow at 9am Eastern and things should get underway shortly after that. The impeachment of the president is assured to pass, but it will likely come at the end of a <i>long</i> day.

  - item: While tonight's vote saw only one Republican break ranks, Rep Adam Kinzinger, tomorrow is going be different. <b>Liz Cheney, the number three ranking Republican in the House, announced tonight that she would vote to impeach. Along with Cheney, today Republicans John Katko, Fred Upton, and Jaime Herrera Beutler also announced their intention to vote for impeachment.</b> "There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution," Cheney said in her announcement. On December 18, 2019, when the House <i>last</i> impeached Donald Trump, no Republicans voted to impeach him, so five stepping forward—and potentially more to come—is <i>a thing</i>.

  - item: The defections announced by Republican House members tonight are significant, but they were overshadowed by a report from the New York Times that <b>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the second most powerful Republican after the President, was "pleased that Democrats are moving to impeach" Donald Trump</b>. Anonymously-sourced reports of McConnell's pleasure are a long way from a vote to convict the president in a Senate trial—which follows impeachment in the House—but it is a significant break away from the President ahead of tomorrow's vote.

  - item: Meanwhile, <b>the President appeared in public for the first time since last Wednesday's siege</b>, flying down to Alamo, Texas—which is not where <i>the</i> Alamo is—to give a speech in front of an unfinished section of border wall. Before boarding Air Force One, he told reporters that his speech last Wednesday ahead of the siege was "totally appropriate." Once in Texas, he said that the 25th amendment was of "zero risk" to him, called the impeachment a "hoax," and warned that that President-elect Joe Biden should "be careful what you wish for." <i>Stares</i>.

  - item: Also today, <b>the FBI and Department of Justice announced that they had more than 160 cases now open stemming from last week's attack on the Capitol</b>. Acting US Attorney Michael Sherwin said in a press conference that they expect the numbers to "geometrically" increase, calling them the "tip of the iceberg." The press conference was the first that federal law enforcement has held since the attack and FBI Director Christopher Wray did not attend, fueling "questions about whether the Trump administration is treating the incident with the seriousness it requires." <i>Ya think?</i>

None of that sounds good, but investigations are ongoing.

  - item: Finally, an additional danger from last Wednesday's attack has emerged&#58; covid-19. <b>Multiple House members have tested positive for the coronavirus after sheltering in place with maskless members during the attack last week.</b> Democratic Representatives Bonnie Watson Coleman, Pramila Jayapal, and Brad Schneider have all announced that they are positive. Rep Jayapal laid blame squarely at the feet of Republican House members who wouldn't wear masks in the saferoom. "Many Republicans still refused to take the bare minimum covid-19 precaution and simply wear a damn mask in a crowded room during a pandemic—creating a superspreader event on top of a domestic terrorist attack," she said.

  tomorrow: The House of Representatives will vote to impeach President Trump for the second time in a little more than a year on Wednesday, January 13, this time with bipartisan support. Buckle up, it's going to be a long one. 
- date: 2021-01-11T17:00:00 #this is Monday Jan 11 7pm
  yesterday: Last Wednesday, January 6, during a joint session of Congress called to affirm the results of the 2020 presidential election, supporters of President Trump laid siege to the Capitol, holding it for hours. Lawmakers were forced into hiding while armed insurrectionists searched the building for them. A gallows was erected outside Congress. Two bombs were found nearby. Five people, including a Capitol Police officer, died. Immediately prior to the attack, the president gave a speech where he urged his supporters to show "strength" and "boldness" against what he told them was a stolen election. In the days since, calls for the President's removal from office have grown louder. 
  todays: 
  - item: It's official. <b>Articles of Impeachment against Donald Trump were introduced in the House of Representatives today.</b> It's been a little more than a year since the last time Trump was impeached by the House. This year's resolution follows the violent siege of the Capitol by Trump supporters last Wednesday in an attempt to subvert the results of the 2020 presidential election. The single article introduced today, "Incitement of Insurrection" places the blame for that siege squarely at the feet of the president, and contends that, in his speech prior to the insurrection, the president "willfully made statements that, in context, encouraged—and foreseeably resulted in—lawless action at the Capitol." The article of impeachment concludes that President Trump "has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national security, democracy, and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office" and his actions warrant "impeachment and trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States."

  - item: In addition to the impeachment resolution introduced today, <b>the House also introduced a resolution calling on Vice President Mike Pence and Trump's Cabinet to invoke the 25th amendment and remove the president from office</b>. The resolution was put up for consideration during today's pro-forma session, but would have required unanimous consent to pass, and was blocked by West Virginia Republican Alex Mooney. Instead, the resolution will go up for a vote tomorrow. The resolution calls for Pence to "immediately use his powers under section 4 of the 25th Amendment to convene and mobilize the principal officers of the executive departments in the Cabinet to declare what is obvious to a horrified Nation&#58; That the President is unable to successfully discharge the duties and powers of his office." The resolution is non-binding and at least as of this writing, the Vice President has not signaled that he's willing to invoke the 25th.

  - item: While they will vote on the 25th amendment resolution on Tuesday, <b>Democrats are preparing for an impeachment vote on Wednesday morning</b>. A vote on Wednesday would fall one week <i>after</i> the siege of the Capitol and one week <i>before</i> President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration—<i>talk about timing</i>. The resolution already has at least 218 co-sponsors, according to Politico, meaning that it would meet "the majority needed for passage in the House." That means that, most likely by the end of the day Wednesday, the President will be impeached for the second time.

  - item: Despite having been present for the attack on the Capitol, Republicans in the House largely oppose impeachment. <b>In a letter sent to his caucus this evening, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who last week voted against affirming Biden's clear electoral victory, wrote that impeachment "would have the opposite effect of bringing our country together."</b> <i>Stares</i>. Despite Republican opposition, impeaching the President in the House only requires a majority vote, which the Democrats have, easily.

  - item: However, as we learned just—<i>checks notes</i>—one year ago, impeachment in the House is different than conviction and removal in the Senate, which requires a 2/3rds majority. Even with the power in the Senate shifting to Democrats next week—when the incoming Georgian Senators, elected in last week's runoff, are joined by incoming Vice President Kamala Harris who will assume her role as President of the Senate—a 2/3 majority will be hard. <b>An impeachment trial in the Senate also poses difficulty when it comes to moving President Biden's agenda forward, including speeding up covid vaccinations and getting more stimulus checks out, as it supersedes other work.</b> While Representative James Clyburn floated the possibility of holding off on the impeachment trial until after Biden's 100 day mark, the President-elect today said he would rather the Senate "bifurcate" their day. “Could you go half a day on dealing with impeachment and half a day getting my people nominated and confirmed in the Senate, as well as moving on the package?" he asked, while getting his second covid vaccination.

  - item: Whenever and however a Senate trial happens, Trump will need a legal team to represent him, which may be a challenge. Many of the lawyers who represented the president in last year's impeachment trial, including Jay Sekulow and Jane Raskin "are not expected to be involved," CNN reports. White House counsel Pat Cipollone, who was heavily involved in the last impeachment as well, is reported to have considered resigning over the president's actions since the election. <b>So who might represent Trump at the trial? CNN reports that celebrity lawyer Alan Dershowitz and Rudy Giuliani are frontrunners.</b> <i>Screams</i>.

  - item: Finally, today saw even more details come out about the ferocity of the attack on the Capitol last week. In addition to the release of harrowing footage of Capitol Police being dragged and beaten by the mob, <b>Nancy Pelosi gave an interview to 60 Minutes where she revealed that her office staffers barricaded a conference room door, turned off the lights, and hid under a table for two and a half hours while the mob sacked the office just outside.</b> <i>My god.</i>

  tomorrow: Tomorrow the House is expected to vote on the 25th amendment resolution which won't really amount to much, but may give a sense of which Republicans are willing to break with the president and potentially back the impeachment vote on Wednesday.
- date: 2021-01-08T20:00:00 #this is FRIDAY
  yesterday: On Wednesday, January 6 2021, during a joint session of Congress called to affirm the results of the 2020 presidential election, a mob of supporters of President Trump stormed the capitol and held it for hours, forcing lawmakers to scramble to safety. Prior to the siege, the president had urged his supporters on, promising to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue with them to demonstrate "strength" and "boldness" against what he told them was a stolen election. He didn't walk with them and the election wasn't stolen, but the damage done by the mob was very real. Later that night, members of congress had begun the work of impeaching the president again.
  todays: 
  - item: It begins. Today, a draft resolution containing articles of impeachment against the president were circulated among lawmakers. <b>The single article in this draft charges "Incitement of Insurrection" and contends that Trump "engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanors by willfully inciting violence against the Government of the United States."</b> By inciting the mob, "President Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of government. He threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coordinate branch of government. He thereby betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States." As a result, the resolution states, the president "warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States." It is expected that the articles will be introduced on Monday, January 11, when the House reconvenes.

  - item: The draft articles capped a <b>furious day of work by Democrats that included a nearly four-hour conference call where House Democrats discussed how to proceed</b>. "The President chose to be an insurrectionist," Pelosi is reported to have told the Democrats on the call. "How we go forward is a subject for this caucus." The call focused on multiple actions to remove the president including impeachment and a resolution to form a commission to invoke the 25th amendment. The potential of introducing multiple avenues for removal was, according to a source cited by Yahoo News, to "let a thousand flowers bloom." Later, Pelosi described the call as "sad, moving and patriotic. It was a conversation unlike any other, because it followed an action unlike any other."

  - item: But the prevailing attitude toward impeachment by Republicans was voiced by senator <b>Lindsey Graham who stated that it's time to "move on" from the siege of the Capitol just two days before</b>. Impeaching the president would "will do more harm than good," he tweeted. <i>Stares</i>.

  - item: <b>One of the biggest challenges facing re-impeaching the president is time itself. His tenure in office runs out in less than two weeks.</b> So how could impeaching him in such a compressed timeframe even work? The key element, for the House at least, is just to jump straight to a vote. The first impeachment of the president was marked by weeks of testimony to the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees but, according to the New York Times, those hearings were "meant to build consensus for such a drastic action" among both lawmakers and the American people and are "not necessary under the rules." Because of this, the House could simply "draw up charges, introduce and proceed directly to a debate and vote on the floor of the House," which is the only realistic course of action given the timeframe.

  - item: Of course, once the House impeaches the president, the action moves to the Senate for a trial and Republicans still control the Senate until inauguration day. Today <b>Mitch McConnell circulated a memo explaining that, well, the Senate is recessed until January 19, the day before Joe Biden's inauguration</b>. There are two pro-forma sessions scheduled for next week but, McConnell's memo explains, "it would require the consent of all 100 Senators to conduct any business of any kind during the scheduled pro-forma sessions prior to January 19, and therefore the consent of all 100 Senators to begin acting on any articles of impeachment during those sessions." Getting 100 Senators to agree on anything—let alone starting an impeachment trial of a president many of them still support—seems unlikely, so an actual impeachment trial wouldn't realistically get underway until the balance of power of the Senate shifts to Democrats on January 20th and Joe Biden becomes president, which, <i>raises eyebrows</i>.

  - item: Finally, late last night <b>it was announced that a Capitol Police officer died after suffering injuries at the hands of the mob at the Capitol on Wednesday</b>. Officer Brian Sicknick, 42, a military vet who served on the Capitol Police force for 12 years "was injured while physically engaging with protesters," according to a statement by the Capitol Police. "He returned to his division office and collapsed." He was taken to a hospital where he died the next day. "The sacrifice of Officer Sicknick reminds us of our obligation to those we serve&#58; to protect our country from all threats foreign and domestic," Nancy Pelosi said in a statement.

  tomorrow: It is expected that the articles of impeachment will be introduced on Monday and that a vote to impeach the president could happen as soon as Wednesday. A week after that, President Trump leaves office one way or another when Joe Biden becomes the 46th president. Hang on to your butts.

  todays: 
  - item: <b>The calls to remove Donald Trump from office grew louder today, with both Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer forcefully demanding he be removed.</b> The siege of the Capitol "was an insurrection against the United States, incited by the president," Schumer said, and Trump "should not hold office one day longer." For Pelosi, "a threshold was crossed of such magnitude," that "I join the Senate Democratic leader in calling on the vice president to remove this president by immediately invoking the 25th amendment. If the Vice President and Cabinet do not act, the Congress may be prepared to move forward with impeachment."

The president's supporters had gathered there to protest the final stage in the presidential election, a process that had begun with Joe Biden's overwhelming victory on November 3rd. The president had fought the results for the last two months, losing dozens of court cases and directly appealing to state lawmakers and officials to overturn the results. It culminated in this speech, delivered just moments before a joint session of congress would be gaveled in to finalize the electoral votes and affirm Joe Biden's victory. <b>In his speech, the president decried the election as an "egregious assault on our democracy" and urging his supporters to "show strength" because "you will never take back our country with weakness."</b> He promised to march down Pennsylvania avenue to the Capitol with them in order to give lawmakers "the boldness they need to take back our country," but once the speech concluded and his supporters, as instructed, headed toward the capitol, he returned to the White House and watched them on TV.
