  todays: 
  todays: 
  - item: <b>Today was the first of two days that the House Managers have to make the case that former president Donald Trump should be convicted for "incitement of insurrection" by the Senate in Trump's second impeachment trial.</b> Over the course of about seven hours of dense presentations by eight House Managers (the Representatives that fill the role of prosecutors in the trial), they methodically  started to make their case, stepping not only through the insurrection of January 6th nearly minute by minute, but also the days, weeks, and months that lead up to it. <b>Representative Joe Neguse characterized the Manager's approach over the next two days as taking three distinct paths&#58; the provocation that lead to the attack, the attack itself, and the harm that followed.</b> Today seemed largely to focus on the provocation and  attack, one would expect tomorrow then to focus on the harm. 
    source:

  - item: Dissecting the many stages of provocation that lead to the attack on January 6 took the first part of the day, as <b>House Managers made the case that the speech Trump gave on the 6th was not the <i>start</i> of his incitement, but the endgame in what had been a "deliberate, planned, and premeditated" attempt to overturn the election that began many months before</b>. Through heavy use of Trump's own tweets, speeches and interviews, the House Managers showed that Trump had been "planting the seeds" of what  they called "the big lie"—that the election was stolen—as early as last spring. That claim continued through the summer and into the fall until, according to Representative Joaquin Castro, Trump "truly made his base believe that the only way he could lose was if the election was rigged." <b>Those false claims of election fraud, said Neguse were "the drumbeat being used to inspire, instigate, and ignite" his supporters.</b>
    source: 
    url:
  - item: <b>That drumbeat continued through the election where, in the days after November 3rd, Trump tweeted to "STOP THE COUNT" and "STOP THE FRAUD"</b> ("this is what it looks like when Donald Trump wants people to stop doing something," Castro noted, teeing up an argument for later). Following Trump's directives, his supporters, some armed, began showing up at vote counting locations to intimidate and disrupt election workers in order to "stop the steal," a refrain that would echo in the Capitol months later. Those mobs "didn't come out of thin air," Castro said.  "They believed him, so they fought."
    source: 
    url: 
  - item: While mobs formed in swing states to "stop the steal," <b>Trump pressed forward with an ever-escalating series of attempts to "retain the presidency," according Representative Madeline Dean including "ignoring adverse court rulings, pressuring and threatening election officials, attacking Senators and members of congress, pressuring the justice department, and attacking Vice President Pence."</b> When each one of these attempts failed, said Representative Ted Lieu, "Trump's actions grew increasingly more desperate." Trump's final, desperate attempt was to intimidate Vice President Pence to refuse to certify the electoral college results on January 6 and, when Pence refused to do that, according to Lieu, <b>"Trump ran out of non-violent options to hang on to power."</b>
    source: 
    url: 
  - item: That meant Trump was back to the mobs he had been inciting to "fight like hell" against a rigged election since the spring and summer,  argued Delegate Stacey Plaskett. Despite knowing that his supporters had used violence in the past, like attempting to run a Biden/Harris bus off a Texas highway (an incident Plaskett said Trump responded to by saying "these patriots did nothing wrong"), Trump began promoting the January 6th event in mid-December, promising that it would be "wild." <b>Throughout 2020, Plaskett said, Trump "cultivated violence, praised it, and when he saw what they were capable of, he channeled it to his big, wild historic event"</b> (an event that Plaskett noted was originally permitted for January 22 and 23rd, after the Inauguration, until the White House got involved—<i>stares</i>).

  - item: <b>Trump's rally on January 6 and the siege of the Capitol that followed occupied the next five hours of the House Managers' presentations.</b> Leaning heavily on video from that day including security camera footage from the Capitol and radio distress calls from capitol police (neither of which had been publically available before), <b>House Managers stepped through the entire insurrection, nearly minute by minute.</b> The sometimes-graphic presentation was excruciating to watch from my couch at home, I can't quite imagine what it must have been like to be a Senator who had been witness to it just over a month ago. Which, certainly, was part of the point of House Managers in presenting it this way. But—as footage played with a map of the capitol superimposed to show the location of the insurrectionists, the Senators, the Vice President, and capitol police officers who helped to avert further disaster—it was a point effectively made.
    source: 
    url:
  - item: <b>Equally effective was House Managers use of their own experiences on January 6, underscoring the unique fact that every person presenting today, and nearly every Senator sitting as jury, was witness to the events as well.</b> From Representative Eric Swalwell recounting that he texted his wife "I love you and the babies, please hug them for me," to Representative Madeline Dean breaking into tears as she recounted the sound of the "battering at the door" of the House chambers, nearly every Manager recounted their own experiences in the Capitol on January 6. It meant something when Representative Dan Cicilline said that the insurrectionists were "coming for us" because he meant <i>literally every person assembled in the room</i>.
    source: 
    url:
  - item: One person not there today that House Managers said the mob was "coming for" was Vice President Mike Pence. <b>They repeatedly portrayed the former Vice President as a "patriot" for fulfilling his constitutional duties in certifying the electoral college results for Joe Biden, and showed through harrowing video how the president turned the mob against him.</b> When Trump tweeted at 2:24pm that day that Pence "didn't have the courage" to overturn the election results, Representative Castro showed footage of that same tweet being read by someone over a bullhorn, which was answered by shouts of "traitor." House managers showed surveillance camera footage of Pence and his family (who had accompanied him to the Capitol) being ushered out of Senate Chambers by secret service and revealed that insurgents "were 60 feet away" from the Vice President. 
    source: 
    url:
  - item: The day wrapped up with a final presentation on "what was happening at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue."   <b>According to House Managers, Trump sat at the White House "delighted" at what was unfolding on TV, doing nothing to stop it.</b> When he finally, two hours into the attack, tweeted for his supporters to "support law enforcement," Representative Castro noted that  even though those very law enforcement officers were "completely, violently" overwhelmed by the mob and needed help he "refused to send it." In fact, according to Castro, <b>there's "no indication" that Trump was ever involved in finally mobilizing the National Guard.</b> The only call into the Capitol that Trump was known to have made, said Representative Cicilline, was to Senator Mike Lee. The call was not to ask about how he could help, or how they were doing, but instead to ask him to continue to delay the election results (after the trial had ended for the day, in a confusing moment, Lee objected to this portrayal). When he finally made a video appeal to his supporters to leave the Capitol, four hours after the insurrection had begun, Trump praised them, saying that they were "very special" and that he knows "how you feel." <b>The president never once told the mob to stop, never once condemned the attack. "On January 6," Castro said. "President Trump left everyone in this capitol for dead."</b> <i>Well then.</i>

  yesterday: Three consecutive Wednesdays at the Capitol in January saw an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/us/politics/trump-speech-capitol.html">insurrection</a>, an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-impeachment-trump/2021/01/13/05fe731c-55c5-11eb-a931-5b162d0d033d_story.html">impeachment</a> and an <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-55736966">inauguration</a>.

  todays: 
  - item: <b>Donald Trump's second impeachment trial began in earnest today with just under four hours of presentations from the House Managers and the President's defense attorneys.</b> The presentations were framed around arguments on whether or not it was actually constitutional to try a former president, but ultimately they served as opening volleys in the cases that each team would present over the next few days.
    source: 
    url:
  - item: It's been predicted that House Managers would lean heavily on video shot on the day of the insurrection to make their case and they wasted no time in doing so today. <b>Lead House Manager Jamie Raskin devoted the first 15 minutes or so of his presentation to a reel that presented a visceral timeline of the day of the insurrection</b>, juxtaposing the president's words with the mob's actions. The video was harrowing, and the knowledge that all of it happened barely more than a month ago in the very halls and chamber that the trial was now taking place made it doubly so. It's a hard thing to watch, but worth devoting the time.

  - item: While much of Raskin's presentation focused on the insurrection and the president's role in it, <b>Representative Joe Neguse spent most of his presentation making the case that there is precedent for holding an impeachment trial after a person is out of office</b>, citing the impeachments of Senators William Blount in 1797 and Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876. Saying that a president inciting a mob in the waning days of his presidency was "the Framers' worst nightmare come to life," Neguse explained that "Presidents can’t inflame insurrections in their final weeks and then walk away like nothing happened. And yet, that is the rule that President Trump asks you to adopt."

  - item: While Neguse made the constitutional argument, <b>much of the work of the House Managers today was about reminding the Senators around them—who are not allowed to leave their seats or check their phones—of the horrors that they themselves were witness to</b>. "The president of the United States sided with the insurrectionists," Representative David Cicilline told the Senate in his presentation. "He celebrated their cause. He validated their attack. He told them, 'Remember this day forever,' hours after they marched through these halls looking to assassinate Vice President Pence, the speaker of the House, and any of us they could find."

  - item: While House Managers made their case in an efficient 90 minutes, <b>Trump's defense team used the full two hours to make a series of looping, meandering arguments</b> including&#58;<ul><li>Senators are good people, which lead lawyer Bruce Castor spent the first 20 minutes of his 50 explaining in a confusing, folksy narrative about his parents and a record they had of former Illinois Senator Everett Dirksen.</li><li> That you shouldn’t silence "free and robust speech," which is what the House Managers want to do by impeaching the president for inciting a mob.</li><li>That the article of impeachment is flawed because it is not broken into multiple articles.</li><li>That House Managers are only doing this because they are afraid of Donald Trump running again and that people "wouldn't be smart enough" to not vote for him.</li><li>That this "isn't about Donald Trump," it's about abusing the constitution "for political gain," as attorney David Schoen argued once he began his circular hour and ten minute presentation.</li><li>That Democrats have been trying to get the President since 2016, a point Schoen illustrated with video clips from news shows for the last four years.</li><li>That Democrats are approaching impeachment like "some kind of bloodsport" and that they won't hold power forever and will face impeachment themselves as a result.</li><li>That convicting the president for inciting an insurrection would "tear this country apart  like we've only seen one other time in our history," which is a wild thing to say after an insurrection that saw National Guard quartered in the capitol for the first time since the Civil War.</li><li>That it's not a real trial because it's not presided over by the Chief Justice.</li></ul>It went on like that for a remarkably long time, both lawyers seemingly free associating between topics almost at random. <b>"The president’s lawyer just rambled on and on,"  Republican Senator John Cornyn told reporters</b> "I’ve seen a lot of lawyers and a lot of arguments, and that was not one of the finest I’ve seen."

  - item: <b>The presentations  wrapped at 5:00 Eastern and were immediately followed by a vote to proceed with the impeachment trial.</b> That vote was expected to mirror a similar vote on the constitutionality of the trial held January 26th, which saw 45 Republicans vote to throw out the trial and 50 Democrats and five Republicans vote to hold it. <b>Today's vote saw those same five Republicans (Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mitt Romney, Ben Sasse, and Patrick Toomey) joined by a sixth, Bill Cassidy from Louisiana</b>, making the final tally 56-44 to move forward with impeachment. Explaining his vote, Cassidy said that Trump's lawyers were "disorganized" and "random" and that they "talked about many things, but they didn't talk about the issue at hand." In voting to move forward, Cassidy said that "the House managers made a compelling, cogent case, and the President's team did not."

- date: 2021-02-08T20:00:00 #this is Monday Feb 8 8pm
  yesterday: Donald Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-impeachment-trump/2021/01/13/05fe731c-55c5-11eb-a931-5b162d0d033d_story.html">was impeached by the House of was impeached by the House of Representatives</a> on January 15th, one week after he implored a crowd to show "strength" against a joint session of Congress, called to affirm his election loss. That crowd then <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/us/politics/trump-speech-capitol.html">laid siege to the Capitol</a>, holding it for hours. A week after that, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-55736966">Trump left office</a> with the inauguration of Joe Biden and days after <i>that</i>, the articles of impeachment were transferred to the Senate, where they were <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/22/schumer-says-senate-will-receive-impeachment-article-on-monday-461305">put on hold</a> until this week. Welcome to Senate trial week.
  todays: 
  - item: <b>The second impeachment trial of Donald Trump begins in the Senate tomorrow and, today, we finally found out how it will work</b>, when Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced that he and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell had agreed on a framework for the trial. The short of it? It's going to be <i>much</i> quicker than last year's trial, which lasted two weeks. Here's the breakdown of how things are slated to go down&#58;<ul><li>
      <b>Noon tomorrow, Tuesday February 9th, will mark the official start of the trial, which will open with a four hour debate and vote over whether or not it's constitutional to try a former president</b>. If this sounds a lot like the vote Rand Paul forced on January 26th, which was about whether or not it was constitutional to try a former president, that's because, well, it is. The big question is whether <i>this</i> vote will be the same as <i>that</i> vote, which saw 45 Republicans vote to toss the trial. Assuming the vote decides that it <i>is</i> constitutional for the Senate to hold an impeachment trial (spoiler alert&#58; it is), then…</li><li>
      <b>Wednesday will kick off arguments, the real meat of the trial, which will last a few days.</b> The House Managers (the prosecutors in the trial) go first and will have up to 16 hours over two days to make their case. Trump's team will then present his defense and will have the same amount of time. Last year, each side had 24 hours over three days, so we're already looking at a shorter trial.</li><li>
      <b>Everyone will take a break before sundown on Friday and the trial will be recessed on Saturday as well</b>, following a request by Trump's attorney David Schoen, who observes the Jewish Sabbath. But come mid-day Sunday, everything gets going again (last year's trial gave everyone Sunday off).</li><li>
      Once each team makes their case—which will either be by the recess on Friday (if Trump's team goes short, which they did last year) or by the end of Sunday (if they take the full time)—<b>Senators will have a total of four hours combined to ask questions of the House Managers and the defense</b> (this is down <i>significantly</i> from last year when they had 16 hours over two days for their questions).</li><li>
      <b>Following the Q&A, there's a vote for witnesses and, if that doesn't pass, each team will have two hours to make their closing arguments.</b> At least as of now, it's not looking like anyone is going to push hard for witnesses (more on that below).</li><li>
      <b>After closing arguments, Senators will vote on whether or not to convict on the single article of impeachment</b>, probably with some speechifying first. Conviction requires a 2/3 majority, which is 67 votes.</li></ul>	
      There are ways that things could take longer, but the general expectation is that this could wrap up quite early next week. If the main arguments wrap by Friday night's recess and there's not much contention around witnesses, you could see how this could wrap as soon as next Monday.

  - item: <b>The rules of the trial weren't the only things delivered today, as more trial briefs came in as well</b>. First up was Trump's legal team, who filed a 47 page brief expanding on the arguments they made in the much shorter brief they filed last week. <b>In today's brief, Trump's lawyers called the impeachment "political theater," and accused House Democrats of suffering from "Trump Derangement Syndrome," and being out to get the former president.</b>  They once again cast the trial itself as unconstitutional, due to Trump no longer being in office, and said that nothing Trump said caused the crowd of his supporters to storm the capitol, explaining that they simply "did so of their own accord and for their own reasons." <i>Stares</i>.

  - item: The House Managers also filed a brief today, a response to the Trump team's filing from last week. <b>Calling the defense's argument "wholly without merit" the House Managers wrote that the former president "has no valid excuse or defense for his actions."</b> Trump's "efforts to escape accountability are entirely unavailing," and his incitement of the mob that stormed the Capitol "merits conviction and disqualification" from holding future office.

  - item: While we now know the basic timeline of the trial, witnesses are still an open question to be decided after each side makes their arguments. This time around, however, <b>there's less emphasis by Democrats on the need to call witnesses.</b> "This is based on a public crime," Senator Richard Blumenthal told reporters. Trump's "intent was unhidden and so I think there’s a danger as there always is for a trial lawyer and prosecutor to over-try, to add more witnesses that prove the obvious." One driver on the aversion for witnesses among at least some Democratic Senators is that lengthening the trial will get in the way of passing legislation like covid relief and approving president Biden's cabinet picks. But ultimately, we won't know what's going to happen with witnesses until the vote happens on Sunday or Monday. However, one witnesses we <i>know</i> won't be called is former president Donald Trump, who was invited by House Managers to testify last week. His lawyers forcibly declined.

  tomorrow: The second impeachment trial of Donald Trump gets underway with four hours of debate about the constitutionality of whether the trial can actually happen or not, which will be riviting.  
- date: 2021-02-02T18:30:00 #this is Tuesday Feb 2 6:30pm
  yesterday: January started with former president Donald Trump spurring a mob to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/us/politics/trump-speech-capitol.html">storm the Capitol</a> on the day that a joint session of congress had assembled to affirm that he had lost the election. Five people died in the siege that followed. A week later, the House of Representatives <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-impeachment-trump/2021/01/13/05fe731c-55c5-11eb-a931-5b162d0d033d_story.html">impeached him for "incitement of insurrection,"</a> making Trump the only president in history to be impeached twice. A week after <i>that</i>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-55736966">he left office</a> with the inauguration of Joe Biden, and days later the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/25/politics/impeachment-article-senate-house/index.html">article of impeachment was transferred to the Senate</a>, only to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/22/schumer-says-senate-will-receive-impeachment-article-on-monday-461305">have the trial delayed</a> until February 9th. All this happened in January. Now, it is February.
  todays: 
  - item: <b>The first briefs of former president Trump's second impeachment trial were filed today</b>, one week ahead of the expected start of the trial. <b>First up was an 80 page document by the House Managers, the congresspeople prosecuting the trial in the Senate, outlining the facts and arguments in their case.</b> After giving a detailed timeline of the day of the insurrection, the brief outlined the House Managers' three arguments&#58;<ul><li><b>President Trump committed high crimes and misdemeanors.</b> "If provoking an insurrectionary riot against a joint session of congress after losing an election is not an impeachable offense, it is hard to imagine what would be," the House Managers argue. This section goes on to explain how, in inciting the mob to lay siege to the Capitol, the former president violated his oath of office, attacked the democratic process, imperiled congress, and undermined national security. Which, when you put it like that, <i>does</i> sound pretty bad.</li><li><b>There is no defense for President Trump's conduct.</b> Here, the House Managers push back against the various defenses that have been offered for the President's actions, especially the assertion that he was simply disputing the results of the election. "We live in a Nation governed by the rule of law, not mob violence incited by candidates who cannot accept their own defeat," the House Managers write. Moreover, they point out that there are plenty of examples of presidents who disputed their loss "yet despite their feelings of grievance, all of these Presidential candidates accepted the election results and acquiesced to the peaceful transfer of power required by the Constitution. President Trump, alone in our nation's history, did not." </li><li><b>The Senate has jurisdiction to try this impeachment.</b> In this final section, the House Managers try and head off what they think will be Trump's main defense&#58; that the Senate can't hold an impeachment trial for a former president. To that, the Managers say there is no "January exception" on impeachment and that the president is the president through the end of his term, and thusly has to answer for actions all the way through it. To not try the former president, the Senate "risks declaring to all future presidents that there will be no consequences, no accountability, indeed no Congressional response at all if they violate their oath" in the final weeks of their term. </li></ul>Beyond the arguments put forth, the brief also gives a good sense of how the House Managers will present their case, putting forward a timeline of events during the insurrection on January 6 that is heavily footnoted with  quotes lifted from video shot by the mob in the capitol. Expect to see that video used on the Senate floor next week.

  - item: A few hours after the House Managers, the ex-president's legal team filed a brief of their own, responding to the original article of impeachment (they'll respond to today's brief by the House next week). After misspelling "United States" as "Unites States" in the first line—<i>stares</i>—<b>the response by Trump's team, as expected, focused on their assertion that the impeachment trial itself is unconstitutional and also leaned into relitigating the 2020 election, because of course</b>. Across 14 pages, Trump's legal assertion is basically&#58;<ul><li><b>He's not the president anymore, so none of this applies to him.</b> <i>No, really.</i> "Since the 45th President is no longer 'President,' his legal team asserts, "the Senate of the United States lacks jurisdiction," over him. Leaving aside his lawyers weird insistence throughout the document to refer to Trump exclusively as "the 45th President" and putting the word President itself when not used in the context of their client in quotes, the argument is dubious ground, but they stake it repeatedly.</li><li>Was the president stoking the flames by repeatedly lying about the election results? According to his lawyers, who can say if he was lying, <i>you know, if you really think about it</i>.  <b>"Insufficient evidence exists upon which a reasonable jurist could conclude that the 45th president’s statements were accurate or not, and he therefore denies they were false."</b> Of course, <i>plenty</i> of "reasonable" jurists—that Trump himself appointed—found that the assertion Trump won the election was false, but, you know, you gotta play the hand you're dealt I guess.</li></ul>

  - item: <b>Trump's legal team didn't have much time to prepare today's document, having only been named yesterday</b>, so that could have something to do with the overall presentation. <i>But wait,</i> you, an astute reader ask, <i>didn't Trump hire a legal team headed by a guy named Butch a couple weeks ago?</i> Yes, he did. But Trump, Butch, and the five other lawyers that had been assembled  to defend him, parted ways this weekend. The reason? "Trump wanted the attorneys to argue there was mass election fraud and that the election was stolen from him rather than focus on the legality of convicting a president after he's left office," CNN reported this weekend. The new team, it seems, decided on a "why not both" approach.

  - item: <b>So what kind of legal team can a former president who's been turned down by most of his previous attorneys assemble at the last minute to defend him in an impeachment trial?</b> Bruce Castor and David Schoen, apparently. <i>Who?</i> Castor is best known as the attorney who refused to prosecute Bill Cosby for sexual assault back in 2005 when he was district attorney in Montgomery County Pennsylvania and Schoen is a lawyer the Washington Post describes as having "ties to several high-profile, controversial defendants, including Roger Stone and Jeffrey Epstein." So this should go great.

  tomorrow: Expect more briefs to be filed by both legal teams on February 8th and 9th, with the trial likely getting underway on the 9th as well. After that is anyone's guess. There's still no word on how long the trial is expected to last, whether witnesses will be called, and whether the House case can convince enough Republican Senators to vote to convict former president Trump.

  yesterday: The second impeachment of Donald Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/25/politics/impeachment-article-senate-house/index.html">moved from the House of Representatives to the Senate yesterday</a>, in a formal ceremony. The transfer happened not even three weeks after then-president Trump spurred an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/us/politics/trump-speech-capitol.html">insurrectionist mob</a> to storm the Capitol and not two weeks after he was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-impeachment-trump/2021/01/13/05fe731c-55c5-11eb-a931-5b162d0d033d_story.html">impeached by the House</a> for the same. A week after <i>that</i>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-55736966">Trump left office</a>, not because he was impeached but because his term was up, having lost the election. January has been a very eventful month, if we're being honest. <i>Cries</i>.
  todays: 
  - item: <b>The Senate was sworn in today for the <i>second</i> impeachment trial of Donald Trump in a year.</b> Just 376 days after the last time, Senators once again swore to do "impartial justice" in the trial of Trump. This time around however, it's for a <i>former</i> president, since Trump left office last Wednesday, and because of <i>that</i>, the presiding officer is not the Chief Justice of the United States but Senator Patrick Leahy, President Pro-Tempore of the Senate. Leahy administered the oath this afternoon. The trial itself won't begin until February 9th.

  - item: Immediately after swearing an oath to do "impartial justice," <b>Republican Senator Rand Paul—<i>stares</i>—forced a vote to throw out the impeachment trial.</b> The reason? "Private citizens don't get impeached," he said. "Impeachment is for removal from office, and the accused here has already left office." The vote failed, but not by much. <b>45 Republicans voted to toss the impeachment trial before it even began, with just five voting to hold it&#58; Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mitt Romney, Ben Sasse, and Patrick Toomey.</b> With 45 votes against even holding the trial, it's not <i>great</i> odds that 17 of 50 Republicans will vote to convict Trump once the trial is over—those 17 joining a presumed 50 Democrats for the needed 67 votes—but we won't know until we know.

  - item: The job of convincing Senators to vote to convict the former President falls to the House managers,  the prosecutors of the impeachment trial. <b>With two weeks before the trial begins, their strategy for trying the case is starting to come into focus&#58; lean into ex-president Trump's words and the way those words spurred the actions of the mob.</b> "Visuals are central in prosecuting the case against Trump," the Washington Post reports, "because the evidence is in plain sight and will remind senators of what they experienced that day."

  - item: <b>Whether witnesses will play a role in making the House manager's case is still an open question.</b> While last year's impeachment trial was effectively ended by a Republican vote to not allow witnesses, Democrats have the majority in the equally-split Senate this year and could likely pass a witness vote. "If either the managers or the defense want to put up witnesses and documents, they should be able to," Senator Tim Kaine told Politico. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer isn't sure calling witnesses will be necessary, however, since "we were all witnesses." Which, well, <i>fair point</i>. The final rules for the trial, including an approach to witnesses, are still in negotiation and likely won't be known for a while yet.

  yesterday: In three consecutive Wednesdays at the US Capitol in January there was an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/us/politics/trump-speech-capitol.html">insurrection</a>, an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-impeachment-trump/2021/01/13/05fe731c-55c5-11eb-a931-5b162d0d033d_story.html">impeachment</a>, and an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/biden-harris-inauguration-day-2021/index.html">inauguration</a>. It's been a busy month, OK? 
  todays: 
  - item: <b>The single article of impeachment was transferred from the House to the Senate today, at 7pm Eastern, with a formal, solemn march through the Capitol by the House managers.</b> The path they took, between the House of Representatives and the Senate chambers, lead them through the very halls of the Capitol that less than three weeks ago were held by the insurrectionist mob. The article of impeachment was read aloud by Congressman Jamie Raskin, the lead House manager, in the Senate chamber. Hearing the one article, "incitement of insurrection," read in front of the Senate dais, the site of some of the more notorious images from <i>that very insurrection</i>, was—well—<i>something</i>. The formal transfer of the article means that the former president's fate now rests with the Senate which will conduct an impeachment trial.

  - item: Normally the transfer of the article of impeachment would pause all other work in the Senate until the trial was over. This time, however, <b>a rules agreement was struck between the newly-in-power Democrats and Republicans to delay the arguments of the trial for two weeks</b> so that the work of the new Biden administration can move forward, including approving cabinet officials and advancing (well, maybe) legislation like covid relief. The extra time also allows ex-president Trump to get his defense together. As a result of the agreement, <b>the next two weeks are expected to look like this&#58;</b><ul><li><b>January 25&#58;</b> The article of impeachment is transferred (that happened tonight).</li><li><b>January 26&#58;</b> Senators are sworn in and a summons is issued to former president Trump.</li><li><b>February 2&#58;</b> Trump's defense answers the article of impeachment and the House managers submit their pre-trial brief.</li><li><b>February 8&#58;</b> Trump's defense issues their pre-trial brief and the House managers respond to Trump's answer from the previous week.</li><li><b>February 9&#58;</b> The House managers issue their response to Trump's latest brief and, at that point, the trial can begin. <i>Wheeeee.</i></li></ul>

However, <b>because Trump is no longer president, today it was announced that Senator Patrick Leahy, the President Pro-Tempore of the Senate will preside</b>. Leahy's role as presiding officer began with the receipt of articles tonight. Interestingly, despite presiding over the trial, it's also expected that Leahy will be able to vote on the conviction of the president as a sitting Senator. "I'm not presenting the evidence," he told reporters today, "I'm making sure the procedures are followed." Just as an aside, Leahy has appeared in five different Batman movies. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/23/us/senator-patrick-leahy-batman-trnd/index.html">No, really</a>.

A week after his impeachment, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-leaves-white-house-ad718c0048c341d0044c4709fb23c8dd">Trump left office</a> when his term ended on Wednesday, January 20, having lost the presidential election to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/biden-harris-inauguration-day-2021/index.html">Joe Biden</a>. Since then, the article of impeachment has been held by the House awaiting transfer to the Senate, which also saw its <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/20/politics/democratic-senators-swearing-in/index.html">balance of power shift this week</a> when Democrats gained a majority. <i>It's been a busy few weeks, OK?</i> Once transferred, the impeachment trial of now ex-President Donald Trump will begin.

  - item: <b>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced today that the article of impeachment against Donald Trump will be transferred to the Senate on Monday, triggering the next stage of the impeachment process, a trial.</b> When asked if it was worth still trying a now-former president, Pelosi answered that "just because he is gone—thank god—you don't say to a president 'do whatever you want the last months of your administration.'" To not try ex-President Trump, Pelosi said, would mean "to forget that people died here on January 6" and that in inciting the mob that stormed the Capitol, the president made an "attempt to undermine our election, to undermine our democracy," and "to dishonor our constitution."

  - item: Transferring the article of impeachment <i>should</i> mean that the Senate immediately transforms into a court and begins holding a trial. However, <b> tonight new Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a rules change to delay the start of the impeachment trial to February 8</b>. The two-week delay would allow the Senate to "continue to do other business for the American people," he said, "such as cabinet nominations and the covid relief bill." How to balance the many immediate needs of the brand-new Biden administration with the demands of an impeachment trial has been an open question since the president was impeached last week (<i>last week??</i>), and now we know the answer. Given the rapid-fire impeachment in the House, the delay will also allow the president more time to prepare a defense, a concern for Republicans.

Though, Politico points out that even the conservative Federalist Society disagrees with this take, saying that "the Constitution permits the impeachment, conviction, and disqualification of former officers, including presidents." But even if it's permitted, it's not going to stop a <i>whole</i> lot of people making this claim come Monday.

  todays: 
  - item: Today started with the expectation that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would shed some light on when the articles of impeachment passed Wednesday would be transferred to the Senate for a trial, the next step in the impeachment process. Instead, <b>Pelosi told assembled press that the articles would <i>not</i> be transferred yet and gave no further timeline except to say that the press would "be the first to know when we announce."</b> What's the holdup? Pelosi explained that preparing the case takes time, and that the House managers—the prosecutors of the trial—are "solemnly and prayerfully preparing." But almost certainly part of the holdup is that, if they transferred articles right now, the trial would begin on Joe Biden's Inauguration Day and would interrupt plans for legislation in the early days of his presidency. Holding the articles in the House allows the Senate to approve Biden's cabinet appointments (which Republicans have not moved on) and address pressing legislation like covid relief. Shifting timing for the trial or adjusting Senate rules to allow for both a trial and other work simultaneously requires a deal to be brokered and one hasn't been yet, so we wait. Maybe for a while, maybe for less.

The impeachment was the fastest ever, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/11/us/articles-impeachment-trump.html">the articles</a> introduced on Monday and a vote on Wednesday. It was also the most bipartisan ever with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/13/us/trump-impeachment#republicans-support-impeachment">ten Republicans</a> breaking ranks to join Democrats in impeaching the president. From here the impeachment process is set to head to the Senate, except... nobody knows when.
  todays: 
  - item: It's the day after the House impeached the president for the second time in a year and all we know, like the song says, is that we don't know nothing. <b>The process is very clear&#58; the impeachment moves from the House to the Senate, where a trial will be held. If the president is convicted, by a 2/3rds majority vote, he will be removed from office and barred from ever running again. But while the process is clear, the reality is much more complicated.</b> The Senate is currently recessed until January 19th, the day before Joe Biden will be inaugurated president and the day before the balance of power in the Senate will shift from Republicans to Democrats. Given that, the <i>soonest</i> a trial could get underway is 1pm on Inauguration Day, not a likely start time for an impeachment trial of what will be, at that point, the <i>previous</i> president. In addition to all that, an impeachment trial takes precedence over other Senate work, unless all 100 Senators consent to a rules change, which feels unlikely, and means that work on Joe Biden's agenda and approving his appointments can't get started. "We are working with Republicans to try to find a path forward," incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told Politico, but what "forward" will look like is anyone's guess. Which is 2021 in a nutshell so far isn't it.

  yesterday: One week ago today, a mob of insurrectionists <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2021/video-timeline-capitol-breach/">laid siege to the US Capitol</a> as a joint session of Congress met to affirm the election of Joe Biden as the 46th President of the United States. The mob stormed the Capitol after a speech from President Donald Trump, delivered just outside the White House, where he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/us/politics/trump-speech-capitol.html">implored them to show "strength" and "boldness" in order to "take back our country"</a> from an election he claimed was stolen. That mob descended on the Capitol, forcing lawmakers into hiding for hours. The insurrectionists erected a gallows and roamed the halls calling the names of the Vice President and the Speaker of the House. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/11/us/who-died-in-capitol-building-attack.html">Five people died</a>, including a Capitol Police officer. Almost immediately, lawmakers <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2021/01/08/alaska-sen-lisa-murkowski-calls-on-president-trump-to-resign-questions-her-future-as-a-republican/">called for the president to step down</a>. Members of the President's cabinet <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-resignations.html">resigned in protest</a>. This Monday a single article of impeachment against the president was introduced in the House, charging <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/11/us/articles-impeachment-trump.html">"Incitement of Insurrection."</a> Today a vote was taken. This all really happened in seven days.  
  todays: 
  - item: <b>The president was impeached today</b>, a week to the day <i>after</i> he incited a mob that laid siege to the Capitol, and a week to the day <i>before</i> he leaves office, having lost the 2020 presidential election. The vote makes him the only president in history to be impeached twice. <b>The final outcome was 232 votes to impeach, 197 against.</b> Every Democrat voted to impeach the president for "Incitement of Insurrection" and were joined by 10 Republicans, making this the most bipartisan impeachment in history (the previous high was when five Democrats voted to impeach Bill Clinton in 1998). Held in chambers that were mostly empty due to coronavirus restrictions and that one week ago were "an actual crime scene," as Massachusetts Rep Jim McGovern reminded those assembled, the debate lasted a little over three hours and was as rancorous as you would imagine. In the end, however, the result was no surprise—Democrats knew they had the votes going in—and so, for just the fourth time in US history, the president has been impeached. Two of those impeachments were Donald Trump.

  - item: While the outcome of the vote was a foregone conclusion, <b>it was an open question whether any Republicans would break with their party and vote to impeach the president. In the end, ten did.</b> Led by Liz Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney and third ranking Republican member of the House, Representatives John Katko, Adam Kinzinger, Fred Upton, Jaime Herrera Beutler, Dan Newhouse, Peter Meijer, Anthony Gonzalez, Tom Rice, and David Valadao all voted to impeach the President. In explaining the break from her party, Washington Rep Jaime Herrera Beutler said "I’m not choosing a side, I’m choosing truth. It’s the only way to defeat fear."

  - item: Of course, while ten Republicans voted to impeach, 197 voted against. <b>Republicans offered a broad range of reasons for their "nay" votes&#58; the President was simply exercising his free speech; the impeachment was rushed; the Democrats were just out for revenge; this was "cancel culture" run amok; and a litany of false equivalencies between the sack of the US Capitol and the Black Lives Matter protests of last summer.</b> The refrain said most commonly was that <i>now</i> was a time for "unity" and that impeaching the president would, as Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said, "further divide the nation." Last week, <i>after</i> the Capitol siege, McCarthy led 139 House Republicans in voting against certifying the results of the presidential election. But today, McCarthy concluded his speech saying that he stood "ready" to work with the Biden administration "with good will." <i>Stares</i>.

  - item: While Republicans called for unity and for moving on, <b>Democrats demanded accountability for the President's actions last week.</b> "We and this country cannot begin healing in unity without accountability and justice," said Michigan Representative Brenda Lawrence, reminding those assembled that "the president incited a violent insurrection against Congress&#58; You, me and the Vice President." That members of Congress were the target of the siege of the Capitol was a regular refrain heard from Democrats, as House members recounted the terror they experienced first-hand just one week ago. "The president of the United States summoned the mob" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said in the final speech of the debate. "Are we to remain silent? Will we not stand up and say this is not acceptable?" he asked. "We must rise to this moment," he answered, and urged the members of the House to "reject sedition, tyranny and insurrection." In the end, 232 members of the House of Representatives did and the President was impeached, again.

The potential for more violence prompted a short statement from President Trump today, issued while debate was ongoing in the House. In his statement he told supporters there "must be NO violence, NO lawbreaking and NO vandalism of any kind." Notably absent from his brief statement—which was short enough to be a Tweet had he not been permanently banned from the platform—were instructions to his supporters not to come.

  - item: So setting aside the terrifying prospect of more violence, what happens next in the impeachment process? As we learned just one year ago, impeachment in the House leads to a trial in the Senate. Well, the presidency isn't the only thing changing hands next week&#58; the Senate will too when Republicans lose their majority. <b>While a Senate trial could theoretically begin before Inauguration Day, outgoing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell today said that he would not call the recessed Senate back early to do so.</b> Meaning that sorting out how to hold an impeachment trial while also not gumming up President-elect Biden's agenda and appointments falls to incoming Senate Majority Leader, Democrat Chuck Schumer. It also means that the trial, which requires a 2/3 majority vote to convict, will happen once President Trump has already left office.

  tomorrow: The broad strokes of what happens next are very simple&#58; the Senate will hold a trial. When that will happen, what it will look like, and if the high bar of a 2/3 majority to convict can be met are all unknown as of this writing. I'm sure someone will think of something. Oh, and in a week Joe Biden will become President of the United States, so there's that too. What could possibly go wrong. Wait, don't answer that.

  yesterday: Yesterday, the House of Representatives introduced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/11/us/articles-impeachment-trump.html">articles of impeachment</a> against President Trump for "incitement of insurrection." The charge stems from last Wednesday, January 6, when the president's supporters <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2021/video-timeline-capitol-breach/">laid siege</a> to the Capitol after a speech where he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/us/politics/trump-speech-capitol.html">implored them to show "boldness" and "strength"</a> against what he claimed was a stolen election. The attack on the Capitol left <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/11/us/who-died-in-capitol-building-attack.html">five people dead</a>, including a Capitol Police officer and immediately lead to <a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2021/01/08/alaska-sen-lisa-murkowski-calls-on-president-trump-to-resign-questions-her-future-as-a-republican/">calls for the president's resignation</a>. He hasn't, and so the House of Representatives moved into a high-speed impeachment with yesterday's introduction of articles. 
  todays:
  - item: After an evening of floor debate—some of which was devoted to complaints from Republicans about newly-installed metal detectors and mask fines—<b>the House of Representatives voted on a resolution calling on Vice President Mike Pence and Trump's Cabinet to remove President Trump from office. The final vote passed 223 to 205 with every Democrat voting for the resolution and all but one Republican, Illinois Representative Adam Kinzinger, voting against it.</b> The resolution is non-binding, so it was not likely to actually lead to the President's removal from office, but it was the first step the House was taking to hold the president accountable for his actions during last Wednesday's attack on the Capitol. 
    source:

  - item: However, just before tonight's vote got underway, <b>Vice President Mike Pence wrote a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi informing her that he would <i>not</i> invoke the 25th</b>, rendering tonight's vote essentially meaningless. He quoted the bible—<i>stares</i>—in giving his reasoning, saying that "for everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven" and that now was a "time to heal." He urged "every member of Congress" to "avoid actions that would further divide and inflame the passions of the moment." A week ago tomorrow, the Vice President was locked down in an undisclosed location while armed insurrectionists roamed the halls of Congress calling his name. During that time, the president he protected tonight never phoned to find out if he was OK.

  - item: <b>Tonight's vote was really about setting up <i>tomorrow's</i> vote, which is on the one article of impeachment introduced <i>just yesterday</i>&#58; "Incitement of Insurrection."</b> If this feels much faster than—<i>checks notes</i>—last year's impeachment, that's because it is. The House has done away with the extensive inquiry and hearings they undertook last year and instead are charging straight to an impeachment vote in the final week of the Trump presidency. They will gavel in tomorrow at 9am Eastern and things should get underway shortly after that. The impeachment of the president is assured to pass, but it will likely come at the end of a <i>long</i> day.

  - item: While tonight's vote saw only one Republican break ranks, Rep Adam Kinzinger, tomorrow is going be different. <b>Liz Cheney, the number three ranking Republican in the House, announced tonight that she would vote to impeach. Along with Cheney, today Republicans John Katko, Fred Upton, and Jaime Herrera Beutler also announced their intention to vote for impeachment.</b> "There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution," Cheney said in her announcement. On December 18, 2019, when the House <i>last</i> impeached Donald Trump, no Republicans voted to impeach him, so five stepping forward—and potentially more to come—is <i>a thing</i>.

Before boarding Air Force One, he told reporters that his speech last Wednesday ahead of the siege was "totally appropriate." Once in Texas, he said that the 25th amendment was of "zero risk" to him, called the impeachment a "hoax," and warned that that President-elect Joe Biden should "be careful what you wish for." <i>Stares</i>.

Acting US Attorney Michael Sherwin said in a press conference that they expect the numbers to "geometrically" increase, calling them the "tip of the iceberg."

  - item: Finally, an additional danger from last Wednesday's attack has emerged&#58; covid-19. <b>Multiple House members have tested positive for the coronavirus after sheltering in place with maskless members during the attack last week.</b> Democratic Representatives Bonnie Watson Coleman, Pramila Jayapal, and Brad Schneider have all announced that they are positive. Rep Jayapal laid blame squarely at the feet of Republican House members who wouldn't wear masks in the saferoom. "Many Republicans still refused to take the bare minimum covid-19 precaution and simply wear a damn mask in a crowded room during a pandemic—creating a superspreader event on top of a domestic terrorist attack," she said.

  tomorrow: The House of Representatives will vote to impeach President Trump for the second time in a little more than a year on Wednesday, January 13, this time with bipartisan support. Buckle up, it's going to be a long one. 
- date: 2021-01-11T17:00:00 #this is Monday Jan 11 7pm
  yesterday: Last Wednesday, January 6, during a joint session of Congress called to affirm the results of the 2020 presidential election, supporters of President Trump laid siege to the Capitol, holding it for hours. Lawmakers were forced into hiding while armed insurrectionists searched the building for them. A gallows was erected outside Congress. Two bombs were found nearby. Five people, including a Capitol Police officer, died. Immediately prior to the attack, the president gave a speech where he urged his supporters to show "strength" and "boldness" against what he told them was a stolen election. In the days since, calls for the President's removal from office have grown louder. 
  todays: 
  - item: It's official. <b>Articles of Impeachment against Donald Trump were introduced in the House of Representatives today.</b> It's been a little more than a year since the last time Trump was impeached by the House. This year's resolution follows the violent siege of the Capitol by Trump supporters last Wednesday in an attempt to subvert the results of the 2020 presidential election. The single article introduced today, "Incitement of Insurrection" places the blame for that siege squarely at the feet of the president, and contends that, in his speech prior to the insurrection, the president "willfully made statements that, in context, encouraged—and foreseeably resulted in—lawless action at the Capitol." The article of impeachment concludes that President Trump "has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national security, democracy, and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office" and his actions warrant "impeachment and trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States."

  - item: In addition to the impeachment resolution introduced today, <b>the House also introduced a resolution calling on Vice President Mike Pence and Trump's Cabinet to invoke the 25th amendment and remove the president from office</b>. The resolution was put up for consideration during today's pro-forma session, but would have required unanimous consent to pass, and was blocked by West Virginia Republican Alex Mooney. Instead, the resolution will go up for a vote tomorrow. The resolution calls for Pence to "immediately use his powers under section 4 of the 25th Amendment to convene and mobilize the principal officers of the executive departments in the Cabinet to declare what is obvious to a horrified Nation&#58; That the President is unable to successfully discharge the duties and powers of his office." The resolution is non-binding and at least as of this writing, the Vice President has not signaled that he's willing to invoke the 25th.

The resolution already has at least 218 co-sponsors, according to Politico, meaning that it would meet "the majority needed for passage in the House." That means that, most likely by the end of the day Wednesday, the President will be impeached for the second time.

  - item: However, as we learned just—<i>checks notes</i>—one year ago, impeachment in the House is different than conviction and removal in the Senate, which requires a 2/3rds majority. Even with the power in the Senate shifting to Democrats next week—when the incoming Georgian Senators, elected in last week's runoff, are joined by incoming Vice President Kamala Harris who will assume her role as President of the Senate—a 2/3 majority will be hard. <b>An impeachment trial in the Senate also poses difficulty when it comes to moving President Biden's agenda forward, including speeding up covid vaccinations and getting more stimulus checks out, as it supersedes other work.</b> While Representative James Clyburn floated the possibility of holding off on the impeachment trial until after Biden's 100 day mark, the President-elect today said he would rather the Senate "bifurcate" their day. “Could you go half a day on dealing with impeachment and half a day getting my people nominated and confirmed in the Senate, as well as moving on the package?" he asked, while getting his second covid vaccination.

  yesterday: On Wednesday, January 6 2021, during a joint session of Congress called to affirm the results of the 2020 presidential election, a mob of supporters of President Trump stormed the capitol and held it for hours, forcing lawmakers to scramble to safety. Prior to the siege, the president had urged his supporters on, promising to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue with them to demonstrate "strength" and "boldness" against what he told them was a stolen election. He didn't walk with them and the election wasn't stolen, but the damage done by the mob was very real. Later that night, members of congress had begun the work of impeaching the president again.
  todays: 
  - item: It begins. Today, a draft resolution containing articles of impeachment against the president were circulated among lawmakers. <b>The single article in this draft charges "Incitement of Insurrection" and contends that Trump "engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanors by willfully inciting violence against the Government of the United States."</b> By inciting the mob, "President Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of government. He threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coordinate branch of government. He thereby betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States." As a result, the resolution states, the president "warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States." It is expected that the articles will be introduced on Monday, January 11, when the House reconvenes.

  - item: The draft articles capped a <b>furious day of work by Democrats that included a nearly four-hour conference call where House Democrats discussed how to proceed</b>. "The President chose to be an insurrectionist," Pelosi is reported to have told the Democrats on the call. "How we go forward is a subject for this caucus." The call focused on multiple actions to remove the president including impeachment and a resolution to form a commission to invoke the 25th amendment. The potential of introducing multiple avenues for removal was, according to a source cited by Yahoo News, to "let a thousand flowers bloom." Later, Pelosi described the call as "sad, moving and patriotic. It was a conversation unlike any other, because it followed an action unlike any other."

  - item: <b>One of the biggest challenges facing re-impeaching the president is time itself. His tenure in office runs out in less than two weeks.</b> So how could impeaching him in such a compressed timeframe even work? The key element, for the House at least, is just to jump straight to a vote. The first impeachment of the president was marked by weeks of testimony to the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees but, according to the New York Times, those hearings were "meant to build consensus for such a drastic action" among both lawmakers and the American people and are "not necessary under the rules." Because of this, the House could simply "draw up charges, introduce and proceed directly to a debate and vote on the floor of the House," which is the only realistic course of action given the timeframe.

  - item: Of course, once the House impeaches the president, the action moves to the Senate for a trial and Republicans still control the Senate until inauguration day. Today <b>Mitch McConnell circulated a memo explaining that, well, the Senate is recessed until January 19, the day before Joe Biden's inauguration</b>. There are two pro-forma sessions scheduled for next week but, McConnell's memo explains, "it would require the consent of all 100 Senators to conduct any business of any kind during the scheduled pro-forma sessions prior to January 19, and therefore the consent of all 100 Senators to begin acting on any articles of impeachment during those sessions." Getting 100 Senators to agree on anything—let alone starting an impeachment trial of a president many of them still support—seems unlikely, so an actual impeachment trial wouldn't realistically get underway until the balance of power of the Senate shifts to Democrats on January 20th and Joe Biden becomes president, which, <i>raises eyebrows</i>.

  - item: Finally, late last night <b>it was announced that a Capitol Police officer died after suffering injuries at the hands of the mob at the Capitol on Wednesday</b>. Officer Brian Sicknick, 42, a military vet who served on the Capitol Police force for 12 years "was injured while physically engaging with protesters," according to a statement by the Capitol Police. "He returned to his division office and collapsed." He was taken to a hospital where he died the next day. "The sacrifice of Officer Sicknick reminds us of our obligation to those we serve&#58; to protect our country from all threats foreign and domestic," Nancy Pelosi said in a statement.

  tomorrow: It is expected that the articles of impeachment will be introduced on Monday and that a vote to impeach the president could happen as soon as Wednesday. A week after that, President Trump leaves office one way or another when Joe Biden becomes the 46th president. Hang on to your butts.

  - item: <b>The calls to remove Donald Trump from office grew louder today, with both Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer forcefully demanding he be removed.</b> The siege of the Capitol "was an insurrection against the United States, incited by the president," Schumer said, and Trump "should not hold office one day longer." For Pelosi, "a threshold was crossed of such magnitude," that "I join the Senate Democratic leader in calling on the vice president to remove this president by immediately invoking the 25th amendment. If the Vice President and Cabinet do not act, the Congress may be prepared to move forward with impeachment."

  - item: The 25th amendment of the constitution allows for a president to be removed from office by the Vice President and 2/3 of the cabinet and, according to ABC News, <b>there have been discussions among "some members of Donald Trump's Cabinet and his allies over invoking the 25th Amendment."</b> Of course, a 2/3 majority of a cabinet hand-picked by Trump feels like a stretch and, as ABC points out, "it's unclear how extensive these conversations have been or whether Vice President Mike Pence is supportive of such action," but that they're happening at all is remarkable.

  - item: Vice President Mike Pence, who was kept at a secure location during the siege of the Capitol yesterday while insurrectionists walked the halls calling his name, is the key to invoking the 25th amendment. <b>Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer called the VP today to discuss the matter with him and, well, "They kept us on hold for 25 minutes,"</b> Pelosi said at her press conference. Once that time was up? They were told "the vice president wouldn't come on the phone." So, well, the 25th seems unlikely.

  todays: 
  - item: It began with a speech on the ellipse directly south of the White House. The president's supporters had gathered there to protest the final stage in the presidential election, a process that had begun with Joe Biden's overwhelming victory on November 3rd. The president had fought the results for the last two months, losing dozens of court cases and directly appealing to state lawmakers and officials to overturn the results. It culminated in this speech, delivered just moments before a joint session of congress would be gaveled in to finalize the electoral votes and affirm Joe Biden's victory. <b>In his speech, the president decried the election as an "egregious assault on our democracy" and urging his supporters to "show strength" because "you will never take back our country with weakness."</b> He promised to march down Pennsylvania avenue to the Capitol with them in order to give lawmakers "the boldness they need to take back our country," but once the speech concluded and his supporters, as instructed, headed toward the capitol, he returned to the White House and watched them on TV.

  - item: What happened next will be in history books forever, as <b>Trumps' supporters quickly overwhelmed a small Capitol Police force and stormed the Capitol building in a siege that lasted for hours</b>. The mob broke into offices, sat at the Senate dais, smashed artifacts and stole others, defecated on the floor, and livestreamed the entire thing. There was an armed standoff at the entrance to the House of Representatives. People carrying zip-tie handcuffs called for Vice President Mike Pence, who had been moved to an undisclosed location. A gallows was erected outside the capitol. Pipe bombs were found outside the Republican and Democratic National Committee offices nearby. When it was over five people, including a Capitol Police officer, were dead.

You’re very special. I know how you feel,”</b> which, <i>stares</i>. Later that night, after the full magnitude of what had unfolded was clear, he continued to voice support for their actions, tweeting "These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots." He ended by saying "Remember this day forever!" The tweet was quickly deleted by Twitter.

"We had a shelter in place order, and then eventually we had to evacuate. They told us to use the gas masks that are under the seats, and we had to scramble across the entire length of the balcony — really frightening. And everyone had to get out."
