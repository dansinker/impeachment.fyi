  yesterday: The second week of the impeachment inquiry has moved rapidly into a legal maneuvering stage, with Democrats issuing subpoenas to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/27/politics/pompeo-congressional-subpoena-ukraine/index.html">Secretary of State Mike Pompeo</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/us/politics/impeach-giuliani-subpoena.html">Rudy Giuliani</a> and those same folks <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/01/mike-pompeo-trump-impeachment-inquiry-democrats-ukraine">pushing back</a> against complying. Tensions, already high, are getting higher, with the president repeatedly calling the impeachment inquiry <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1178643854737772545">treasonous</a>. It's been a week, and it's only Wednesday.
  todays: 
  - item: Wednesday opened with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo telling reporters traveling with him in Rome that he was listening in on the call between Trump and Ukranian president Zelensky--he had not previously revealed his presence on the call. "Asked if the call raised any red flags in his mind, Pompeo did not respond. "

  - item: Later in the morning, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi held her weekly press conference where she was joined by Chair of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff. At the presser, Schiff said that if the President or the administration interferes in the impeachment inquiry, "any action like that that forces us to litigate or have to consider litigation will be considered further evidence of obstruction of justice."

  - item: Meanwhile, Chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee Elijah Cummings issued a letter stating that if the White House did not voluntarily produce documents related to Trump's Ukraine call by Friday, he would subpoena them. "I do not take this step lightly," he wrote.

  - item: Then Trump held a wild press conference with the president of Finland where he once again called for Schiff to be "looked into for treason" and claimed that Schiff wrote the whistleblower report himself. And then it <i>really</i> went off the rails, ending with Trump screaming at Fox News reporter John Roberts to ask a question to the Finnish president instead of continually pressing him about the Ukraine call.

  - item: Finally, the New York Times offered a revealing look at the early days of the whistleblower complaint, including the detail that the whistleblower, following correct procedure, approached an aide at the House Intelligence Committee about their complaint after they felt it wasn't moving forward at the CIA. "The House staff member, following the committee’s procedures, suggested the officer find a lawyer to advise him and meet with an inspector general, with whom he could file a whistle-blower complaint." This is already being mischaracterized by the president as direct involvement by Schiff in the complaint.

  tomorrow: At this point it definitely feels like "all hell breaks loose" is an option, but beyond that, former US Special Envoy to the Ukraine Kurt Volker is scheduled to testify in the House tomorrow, and then there's the Friday deadline on Rep. Cummings threat to subpoena the White House.

Subpoenas have gone out to both <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-issue-subpoena-pompeos-ukraine-documents/story?id=65912440">Secretary of State Mike Pompeo</a> and the president's <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-issue-subpoena-pompeos-ukraine-documents/story?id=65912440">personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani</a>, who seems to be at the center of much of the Ukraine intrigue. 
  todays: 
  - item: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took to Twitter this morning to say that the Democrats were attempting to "intimidate, bully, & treat improperly the distinguished professionals of the Department of State" by asking for five current and former officials to testify. Democrats responded by saying that "any effort to intimidate witnesses or prevent them from talking with Congress--including state department employees--is illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry."

  - item: That didn't stop Schiff, along with Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Eliot Engel and Oversight Committee Chair Elijah Cummings from issuing a subpoena to Rudy Giuliani. "Our inquiry includes an investigation of credible allegations that you acted as an agent of the president in a scheme to advance his personal political interests by abusing the power of the Office of the President," reads the subpoena in part, and it demands that Giuliani produce “text messages, phone records, and other communications” related to his dealings in Ukraine.
