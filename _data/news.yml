  yesterday: After a week of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/us/politics/impeachment-white-house-subpoena.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage">legal wrangling</a> by the Democrats and <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cnn-trump-bullshit-vulgarity_n_5d94dea1e4b0ac3cddb27d0e?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALXA_r29kaLfKOszR71iz8XBQhQluFvati-BG3gNQ5Bqve8H19kTTrOSBZ4zuJpKpj3bHKFg9mTPHYd5YLtyLi27XQjwojbFiSXicwsZOYovBWZtZhdDzujp9pq8nb8aMhgcAbHU17o7aA-U6m-I4naHA25XDthdcUSQmW3zN-AM">explosive statements</a> to the press by the president, yesterday ended with the <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/_cache/files/5/0/50759349-fe81-4444-a990-65c92528de82/50EE8A2F1CFC493A98876200762152FC.chairmen-letter-on-state-departmnent-texts-10-03-19.pdf">evening release of text messages</a> between various State Department officials that largely corroborated the whistleblower's original complaint that the president was witholding military aid from Ukraine in order to pressure them to investigate Joe Biden. It was quite a way to (almost) wrap the week. Which brings us to...
  todays: 
  - item: Low-key looming over today has been the end of the deadline set by Elijah Cummings, chair of the House Oversight Committee, for the White House to turn over documents related to the Ukrainian phone call or face a subpoena to do the same. Well, guess what? The White House didn't comply, and so just as this update was being drafted, a subpoena was sent to White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. The White House now has until October 18 to comply. "Your failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena," the accompanying letter reads, "including at the direction or behest of the President or others at the White House, shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House's impeachment inquiry and may be used as an adverse inference against you and the President."

  - item: According to a report by Axios, the White House is readying a response "arguing that President Trump and his team can ignore lawmakers' demands until [Pelosi] holds a full House vote formally approving an impeachment inquiry." Which doesn't seem to have a lot of legal standing, but here we are.

  - item: Meanwhile, if you've been wondering whatever happened to Vice President Pence, who seems to have gone missing, last night the Washington Post broke a story that Trump "repeatedly involved Vice President Pence in efforts to exert pressure on the leader of Ukraine at a time when the president was using other channels to solicit information that he hoped would be damaging to a Democratic rival." Sources close to Pence say he was "unaware" of Trump's motivations to get information on Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Which, OK sure.

  - item: And, citing in part the Washington Post's report, today House investigators sent a letter to the Vice President requesting a sprawling list of documents related to actions involving Ukraine. It's not a subopoena, yet, but Pence's deadline is October 15.

  tomorrow: It's the weekend, surely nothing will happen, right? But next week, expect extensive fireworks surrounding these latest subpoenas and document requests. This weekend though, let's all just hit the sauna or something. .

  yesterday: This week's impeachment news has been largely defined by <a href="ttps://www.cnn.com/2019/09/27/politics/pompeo-congressional-subpoena-ukraine/index.html">legal wrangling</a> and issuing statements to the press by both <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cnn-trump-bullshit-vulgarity_n_5d94dea1e4b0ac3cddb27d0e?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALXA_r29kaLfKOszR71iz8XBQhQluFvati-BG3gNQ5Bqve8H19kTTrOSBZ4zuJpKpj3bHKFg9mTPHYd5YLtyLi27XQjwojbFiSXicwsZOYovBWZtZhdDzujp9pq8nb8aMhgcAbHU17o7aA-U6m-I4naHA25XDthdcUSQmW3zN-AM">the President</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fooling-house-democrat-leading-impeachment-probe/story?id=66004383">the Democrats</a>. The presidents statements have been <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/02/politics/president-donald-trump-impeachment-democrats-pompeo/index.html">far more inflamatory</a>, and the Democrats have been firing back with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/us/politics/impeachment-white-house-subpoena.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage">legal threats</a>. It's been a long week. 
  todays:
  - item: LATE UPDATE—Late Thursday night, the three chairs of the House Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs committees released a series of texts they obtained from former US Special Envoy to the Ukraine Kurt Volker. In the letter that accompanies the release they write that these texts reflect concerns that "critical military assistance and the meeting between the two presidents were being withheld in order to place additional pressure on Ukraine to deliver on the President's demand for Ukraine to launch politically motivated investigations." They are truly wild and include conversations between State Department officials that largely corroborate and add further context to the whistleblower's report. As Bill Taylor, the Charge d'Affaires (the acting ambassador, essentially) at the US Embassy in Ukraine asks in one of the texts, "Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?" Yes, yes we are.

  - item: Some days you try hard to come up with a lead story and some days Donald Trump stands on the White House lawn and asks Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. And then ask China to do it too.  Ukraine "should investigate the Bidens," he said to reporters on live TV, "because how does a company that's newly formed—and all these companies—and by the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine." This really happened.

  - item: Meanwhile, the Democrat's impeachment inquiry that centers on whether Trump asked the Ukraine to investigate a political rival continued, despite the fact that he did so live on television moments before. Today saw former US Special Envoy to the Ukraine Kurt Volker testify that he "warned President Trump’s personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, that Giuliani was receiving untrustworthy information from Ukrainian political figures about former vice president Joe Biden and his son." Volker resigned his position last week after being implicated in the whistleblower report.

  - item: Speaking of Volker, the Guardian has an excellent look into how this "mild-mannered former ambassador to Nato" ended up enmeshed in this whole fiaso. The short of it? "He really tried to have his cake and eat it, thinking he could operate inside the administration with one foot outside, that would give him some flexibility. But those two things were incompatible."

  - item: And finally, because today wasn't absurd enough, '90s powergrunge band/internet meme Nickelback issued a copyright infringement notice against a tweet from the president that used the band's video for the song "Photograph" to implicate Joe Biden and his son Hunter in dealings with the Ukranians. Writing this sentence made me very tired.

  tomorrow: Tomorrow is Elijah Cummings deadline for White House cooperation to turn over documents or he's subpoenaing them, so that should be interesting. Also, it's Friday tomorrow, I'm sure it will be chill. TGIF right? 
- date: 2019-10-02
  yesterday: The second week of the impeachment inquiry has moved rapidly into a legal maneuvering stage, with Democrats issuing subpoenas to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/27/politics/pompeo-congressional-subpoena-ukraine/index.html">Secretary of State Mike Pompeo</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/us/politics/impeach-giuliani-subpoena.html">Rudy Giuliani</a> and those same folks <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/01/mike-pompeo-trump-impeachment-inquiry-democrats-ukraine">pushing back</a> against complying. Tensions, already high, are getting higher, with the president repeatedly calling the impeachment inquiry <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1178643854737772545">treasonous</a>. It's been a week, and it's only Wednesday.
  todays: 
  - item: Wednesday opened with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo telling reporters traveling with him in Rome that he was listening in on the call between Trump and Ukranian president Zelensky--he had not previously revealed his presence on the call. "Asked if the call raised any red flags in his mind, Pompeo did not respond. "

  - item: Later in the morning, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi held her weekly press conference where she was joined by Chair of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff. At the presser, Schiff said that if the President or the administration interferes in the impeachment inquiry, "any action like that that forces us to litigate or have to consider litigation will be considered further evidence of obstruction of justice."

    url: https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fooling-house-democrat-leading-impeachment-probe/story?id=66004383
  - item: Meanwhile, Chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee Elijah Cummings issued a letter stating that if the White House did not voluntarily produce documents related to Trump's Ukraine call by Friday, he would subpoena them. "I do not take this step lightly," he wrote.

    url: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/us/politics/impeachment-white-house-subpoena.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage
  - item: Then Trump held a wild press conference with the president of Finland where he once again called for Schiff to be "looked into for treason" and claimed that Schiff wrote the whistleblower report himself. And then it <i>really</i> went off the rails, ending with Trump screaming at Fox News reporter John Roberts to ask a question to the Finnish president instead of continually pressing him about the Ukraine call.
    source: CNN
    url: https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/02/politics/president-donald-trump-impeachment-democrats-pompeo/index.html
  - item: Finally, the New York Times offered a revealing look at the early days of the whistleblower complaint, including the detail that the whistleblower, following correct procedure, approached an aide at the House Intelligence Committee about their complaint after they felt it wasn't moving forward at the CIA. "The House staff member, following the committee’s procedures, suggested the officer find a lawyer to advise him and meet with an inspector general, with whom he could file a whistle-blower complaint." This is already being mischaracterized by the president as direct involvement by Schiff in the complaint.

  tomorrow: At this point it definitely feels like "all hell breaks loose" is an option, but beyond that, former US Special Envoy to the Ukraine Kurt Volker is scheduled to testify in the House tomorrow, and then there's the Friday deadline on Rep. Cummings threat to subpoena the White House.
- date: 2019-10-01
  yesterday: We entered week two of the impeachment inquiry that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/read-the-whistleblower-complaint-regarding-president-trump-s-communications-with-ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelensky/4b9e0ca5-3824-467f-b1a3-77f2d4ee16aa/">stemmed from a whistleblower complaint</a> about a phone call Trump had with the president of Ukraine in July. Subpoenas have gone out to both <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-issue-subpoena-pompeos-ukraine-documents/story?id=65912440">Secretary of State Mike Pompeo</a> and the president's <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-issue-subpoena-pompeos-ukraine-documents/story?id=65912440">personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani</a>, who seems to be at the center of much of the Ukraine intrigue. 
  todays: 
  - item: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took to Twitter this morning to say that the Democrats were attempting to "intimidate, bully, & treat improperly the distinguished professionals of the Department of State" by asking for five current and former officials to testify. Democrats responded by saying that "any effort to intimidate witnesses or prevent them from talking with Congress--including state department employees--is illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry."
