  yesterday: The President of the United States was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-impeachment-live-updates/2019/12/18/237147e8-2110-11ea-bed5-880264cc91a9_story.html">impeached by the House of Representatives on December 18th.</a> Since that point, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/03/trump-senate-impeachment-trial-093290">Washington has been in a limbo state</a>, waiting for the articles of impeachment to be turned over to the Senate. In the meantime, <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/1/8/21055228/australia-fires-map-animals-koalas-wildlife-smoke-donate">the world caught fire</a> or <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/08/us/puerto-rico-region-hundreds-of-earthquakes/index.html">started quaking badly</a>, and things <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/06/world/middleeast/iran-soleimani-trump.html">got scary with Iran</a>, and still we wait.
  todays: 
  - item: For the first time since the House reconvened for the new year, <b>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spoke to reporters today about what she would need to see before turning over the articles of impeachment to the Senate for a trial.</b> "We are waiting to see what the terms are," she explained, because "how we choose our managers depends on what the arena is that we are going into." What she means is that when the articles do move to the Senate, House impeachment managers, chosen by Pelosi, act as prosecutors in the trial. Without knowing how the trial will run, Pelosi says, she can't choose the right managers to try the case. I mean, <i>OK</i>? But also, well, everything below.

  - item: As you might expect, <b>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was having none of it</b>, insisting once again that "there will be no haggling with the House over Senate procedure." Yesterday, McConnell announced that he had the 51 votes necessary to define the rules of the trial once the Senate receives the articles of impeachment from the House. "We will not cede our authority to try this impeachment," McConnell said in response to Pelosi. "The House’s turn is over. The Senate has made its decision."

  - item: But clearly not <i>everybody</i> in the Senate has made their decision. <b>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer took to the op-ed pages of USA Today, er, today to once again make the case for witnesses at the trial.</b> "We are not asking for critics of the president to serve as witnesses in a trial. We are asking that the president’s men—his top advisers—tell their story, and for the Senate to have access to the documents that will shed light on the truth." Which <i>yes absolutely</i>, but that and 51 votes makes it happen and more and more it looks like those votes are simply not there.

  - item: <b>Other Senators in Schumer's party are starting to cave to the pressure to get the trial started in the Senate.</b> "The longer it goes on the less urgent it becomes," California Senator Diane Feinstein said today, "so if it’s serious and urgent, send them over. If it isn’t, don’t send it over.” For Montana's Democratic Senator Jim Testor, "I don’t know what leverage we have," he told Politico, "it looks like the cake is already baked." Which sounds <i>delicious</i>, but Testor is talking about resigning himself to what's possible rather than talking about dessert. Delaware Senator Chris Coons also wasn't talking about dessert when he said, "I do think it is time to get on with it." <i>Mmmm dessert.</i>

  - item: While there's a great deal of external pressure on her at this point, Nancy Pelosi is still playing her hand very close to her chest. However, <b>Senate Minority Whip Dick Durban today said that he expected that Pelosi will be making a decision soon.</b> "I understand she may make a decision in the next few days," he said during an appearance on CNN. "But that’s entirely up to her." In defending her delay he added, "What’s she been looking for is not unreasonable. The Constitution calls for a trial in the Senate. She has asked what that trial will be. As one my colleagues said the other day, a trial has witnesses. A coverup does not have witnesses." Of course, a coverup <i>does</i> have witnesses, which is really what this is all about.

  tomorrow: As you can surmise from above, everything moving forward from here currently boils down to "when will the articles be delivered to the Senate"? One person knows the answer to that question, and she's not telling. Yet.

  yesterday: Washington returned from their winter recess yesterday into a political landscape that has to balance both the potential of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/06/world/middleeast/iran-soleimani-trump.html">war with Iran</a> and the looming <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-impeachment-live-updates/2019/12/18/237147e8-2110-11ea-bed5-880264cc91a9_story.html">impeachment</a> trial of the president who would wage it. Which was why it was especially surprising that noted Iranian war hawk John Bolton chose <i>yesterday</i> to <a href="https://www.boltonpac.com/2020/01/statement-of-john-r-bolton/">issue a surprise statement</a> that he would testify, if subpoenaed, in a Senate trial. Of course, when that trial would take place is still up in the air as <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/03/trump-senate-impeachment-trial-093290">an impasse continues</a> between Senate Republicans and House Democrats. Which brings us to today.
  todays: 
  - item: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said today that <b>Republicans have the votes in the Senate to set the rules of the impeachment trial without any Democratic input</b>. With only 51 votes needed, that's been assumed for some time, but this is the first time McConnell has come out and said that the majority could move forward in this way. So what are the rules McConnell is proposing? "All we are doing here is saying we are going to get started in exactly the same way 100 senators agreed to 20 years ago," McConnell told reporters. "What was good enough for President Clinton is good enough for President Trump." What does that mean? It means that the question of witnesses would be kicked to after opening arguments by the House impeachment managers and the president's defense lawyers, which is how it was done during the trial of President Clinton. In that trial, witnesses <i>were</i> called, though that's no guarantee that would happen this time around. Of course, the rules vote can't happen until  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi releases the articles of impeachment, which as of now she has given no indication will happen soon.

  - item: McConnell's hand was strengthened by the statements of two Republican Senators that were on a very short list of Senators Democrats had hoped might call for witnesses at this stage, especially after yesterday's surprise announcement by former National Security Advisor John Bolton that he would testify if subpoenaed. <b>Both Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski said today that they backed McConnell's plan of delaying a vote on witnesses.</b> "I think we need to do what they did the last time they did this,” Murkowski said. “And that was to go through a first phase, and then they reassessed after that." Collins—who had previously said she was "disturbed" that McConnell was coordinating the trial with the White House—now believes that it's "difficult to decide in isolation before we have heard the opening statements."

  - item: <b>Even a few Senate Democrats are now calling on Pelosi to turn over the articles of impeachment.</b> Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy and West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin—who are ideologically quite far apart from each other—said today that the time has come for the Senate to start the impeachment trial. "I think it needs to start," Manchin told reporters, "I really do. I can't tell the House how to do their business," but "let us do what we have to do over here." Murphy echoed Manchin's sentiments saying "I think the time has past. She should send the articles over."

  - item: Meanwhile, <b>President Trump reacted to yesterday's Bolton surprise by saying that his former National Security Advisor doesn't know anything.</b> "He would know nothing about what we’re talking about because, if you know, the Ukrainian government came out with a very strong statement 'no pressure, no anything,' and that’s from the boss," Trump told reporters. Of course many of the two dozen witnesses during the House's impeachment investigation specifically called out John Bolton as someone who was in opposition to the president's Ukrainian "drug deal" (his words), and he most likely very much knows what he's talking about but, hey, let's just go with he doesn't.

  - item: Finally, while Senate Republicans are attempting to delay a decision about whether or not Bolton, or other witnesses, should testify in the impeachment trial, <b>House Intelligence chair Adam Schiff, who ran the open testimony during the House's impeachment investigation, said today that he hasn't taken issuing a subpoena to John Bolton himself "off the table."</b> However, he added "I think what makes the most sense, though, frankly, is for him to testify in the Senate trial." Of course, he also admits that Senate Republicans likely want "to dismiss the matter, make it go away, so the president’s conduct can be covered up," so perhaps he should reconsider the whole "just have Bolton testify at the trial" thing <i>because  that seems unlikely my dude</i>.

  tomorrow: Literally as I was writing this update, Iran fired missiles at US bases in Iraq, so what I was <i>going</i> to say was that we will likely hear Nancy Pelosi's plans for the articles of impeachment in the next few days, but now literally all bets are off. Be safe.

  yesterday: Way back in 2019 which was—<i>checks calendar</i>—six days ago, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-impeachment-live-updates/2019/12/18/237147e8-2110-11ea-bed5-880264cc91a9_story.html">the president was impeached</a> by the House of Representatives. Since that time, Congress went on holiday break, the world <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-50951043">literally caught fire</a>, <i>and</i> the president may have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/06/world/middleeast/iran-soleimani-trump.html">set off a war with Iran</a>, so like there's a lot going on. But winter break is over and despite, well, everything, the impeachment of President Donald Trump will continue. So let's go.
  todays: 
  - item: After two weeks off for winter break during which <i>waves hands in all directions</i> happened, <b>both the Senate and the House returned to Washington today and found the impasse on the next step of the impeachment proceedings pretty much exactly where they left it back in December</b>. Where was that again?  Well&#58;<ul><li>The president was impeached by the House of Representatives on December 18th.</li><li>However, the House has not yet turned over the articles of impeachment to the Senate, which is required in order to start a trial of the president.</li><li>This is because House Democrats believe that they need to secure assurances that the Senate trial will include witnesses called by both sides. By withholding the articles, Democrats believe they can exert leverage over the Senate process.</li><li>Republican Senators, as you might expect, disagree and, since they have a 53 seat majority in the Senate, could proceed with setting rules for the Senate trial (which only need 51 votes) without Democratic input—but they need the articles first.</li></ul>What that means is that, at least as of now, "It may feel like we are no closer to establishing the rules for a Senate trial than when we last met," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. "But the vital question of whether or not we have a fair trial ultimately rests with a majority of the senators in this chamber." Senate Republicans are planning on meeting tomorrow to discuss where to go from here.

  - item: The question of witnesses has largely been about whether an impeachment trial in the Senate could compel testimony from people like White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney or former National Security Advisor John Bolton, both of whom defied House requests for depositions. That question has been largely academic until today. <b>Today John Bolton issued a statement that he <i>would</i> testify in a Senate trial if subpoenaed.</b> "Since my testimony is once again at issue," he wrote, "based on careful consideration and study. I have concluded that, if the Senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, I am prepared to testify." <i>Well then</i>.

  - item: Reaction to Bolton's statement today was rapid. Senate Democrats naturally pointed to it in ratcheting up their demands for witnesses at the trial. But so did Republican Senator Mitt Romney. <b>Bolton, Romney told reporters, "has first-hand information and assuming that articles of impeachment do reach the Senate, I'd like to hear what he knows."</b> With the slim majority held by the Republicans in the Senate, only four members would need to break from the party line in order to influence the rules of the impeachment trial. Romney, along with a handful of other Republicans, is among the best bet for that outcome. However, he quickly added that he wouldn't comment on the process in the Senate, because "the leaders are trying to negotiate that process right now." I'm not sure that there <i>is</i> actually a negotiation underway, but hey you do you Mitt.

  - item: Much of Bolton's short statement today focused on the lawsuit filed last fall by his colleague at the National Security Council, Charles Kupperman. Kupperman had asked a judge to decide whether he should abide by House subpoena or the White House's directive of non-compliance in the impeachment inquiry. <b>Last week, a judge ruled that Kupperman's question was moot because the House had rescinded the subpoena.</b> In issuing his statement, however, Judge Richard Leon said that he has "no doubt though, should the winds of political fortune shift and the House were to reissue a subpoena to Dr. Kupperman, he will face the same conflicting directives that precipitated this suit. If so, he will undoubtedly be right back before this Court." But, Leon added, "Fortunately, however, I need not strike that balance today." Which, <i>thanks for not much?</i> Interestingly, Leon's failure to rule seems to have forced Bolton to actually decide for himself.

  - item: The Kupperman non-ruling wasn't the only thing to happen last week that has the potential to impact the impeachment trial. <b>Unredacted emails between the White House Office of Management and Budget and the Pentagon surfaced last week that show deep concern by the Pentagon over the hold placed on Ukrainian military aid by the President.</b> According to the legal policy website Just Security, the emails "reveal growing concern from Pentagon officials that the hold would violate the Impoundment Control Act, which requires the executive branch to spend money as appropriated by Congress, and that the necessary steps to avoid this result weren’t being taken." Why not? The emails cite "clear direction from POTUS to continue to hold." So, like, well, <i>screams</i>. Along with witnesses, Senate Democrats have requested these and other documents from the Office of Management and Budget.

  - item: Finally, because two weeks can't possibly go by without Rudy Giuliani or his associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman getting up to <i>something</i>, <b>a judge ruled last week that Parnas could share documents along with the contents of a cell phone with House Investigators</b>. The material, described as, "two batches of documents seized from his home and the contents of one of his iPhones," was originally seized by federal investigators when they arrested Parnas and Fruman before they left the country back in October, <i>if you have forgotten just how wild things got in the early days of all this</i>. House investigators had requested that material some time ago and now, with this ruling, they'll get it this week. "Review of these materials is essential to the Committee’s ability to corroborate the strength of Mr. Parnas’s potential testimony," his lawyer said. What testimony, you ask? Yes, exactly. <i>What testimony indeed.</i> Welcome back.

  tomorrow: With the world literally both on fire and on the brink of war, the impeachment may seem like a distant memory, but the Senate's calendar is empty this month specifically for the trial, the president <i>was</i> impeached, and things are going to start moving forward again because I can't imagine that Democrats are going to want to drag this <i>too</i> far into the presidential primary calendar but also, well, a lot of stuff has happened that I can't imagine. Like, everything. It's nice (?) to be back. <i>Cries</i>.

  yesterday: On September 24, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/democrats-impeachment-trump.html">announced that the House was undertaking an impeachment inquiry</a> against the president after a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/read-the-whistleblower-complaint-regarding-president-trump-s-communications-with-ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelensky/4b9e0ca5-3824-467f-b1a3-77f2d4ee16aa/">whistleblower reported</a> that the president had solicited political favors from Ukraine <a href="https://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=6429015-Trump-Ukraine-Transcript">on a call</a> between Trump and Ukrainian president Zelensky back in July.

  todays: 
  - item: <b>The final day of the legislative calendar for 2019 saw no movement in the stalemate between the House and the Senate in moving forward with the impeachment trial</b> now that the articles of impeachment have been passed in the House. Both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are "roaming freely between the lines of the Constitution," Politico writes, "which spells out very little about the technicalities of the impeachment process." At the center of the dispute are a series of statements by McConnell in the last few weeks that call into question whether a fair trial will be held. As a result, Pelosi opted to hold on to the articles of impeachment as a bargaining chip to get concessions from the Republican-majority Senate. "It was definitely the right thing to do knowing you were sending it to what looked like ... an unfair trial," conservative Democrat Joe Manchin told Politico. "So if she can help us get a fair trial that’s what we want to do." As of now, it looks like there won't be any resolution on this before the ball drops on the new year.

  - item: With the delay of articles of impeachment currently sitting at the center of a Constitutional grey area, Constitutional scholar and lawyer <b>David Feldman, who earlier this month testified in the Judiciary Committee's impeachment hearings as a witness for the Democrats, weighed in on what the delay might mean.</b> His assessment? "If the House does not communicate its impeachment to the Senate, it hasn’t actually impeached the president." That said, Feldman also points out that "the Constitution doesn’t say how fast the articles must go to the Senate," and that while a "modest" delay isn't an issue, "an indefinite delay would pose a serious problem." <i>Fun times.</i>

  - item: Feldman's "problem" scenario of the House never delivering articles of impeachment to the Senate is unlikely, which means that whenever the House finally delivers the articles, a trial in the Senate will get underway. In an impeachment trial in the Senate, Senators act as the jury, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court John Roberts sits as the judge, and impeachment managers selected by the House of Representatives act as prosecutors. So <b>what have Senators said about the impeachment process that they will sit on the jury of?</b> The New York Times has compiled an excellent look.

  - item: A central issue in the delay of delivery of articles of impeachment is the Democratic request for witnesses in the trial. With the Republican majority in the Senate, they could pass the rules for a speedy trial without witnesses with only 51 votes, essentially locking out Democratic input. Of course, <b>complicating life for Republicans—who desire a fast acquittal of the president in the Senate—is the president himself who is "harboring a desire to create a flashy, testimony-filled trial, fueled by a belief that such an approach would vindicate him and embarrass Democrats,"</b> Politico reported today. "We don’t want a quick technical acquittal but complete exoneration," an advisor to the president told Politico. With the president's proclivity for complicating his own life, I wouldn't write off the possibility that <i>he</i> will ultimately force a lengthier trial with witnesses called by both sides, which, <i>gestures wildly in all directions</i>.

The Iowa caucus is February 3, followed by the New Hampshire primary on February 11. At this point, the absolute fastest one can expect a trial to start in the Senate is January 6, and that feels fleeting at this point, so, uh, <i>yyyyyeah</i>.

  yesterday: Yesterday the House of Representatives <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-impeachment-live-updates/2019/12/18/237147e8-2110-11ea-bed5-880264cc91a9_story.html">voted to impeach President Trump</a>. The vote, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/18/us/politics/trump-impeachment-vote.html">which split almost completely along party lines</a>, was 230-197 on Article I, Abuse of Power, and 229-198 on Article II, Obstruction of Congress. December 18, 2019 was only the third time in the history of the United States that a president was impeached—whatever happens next, that will always be true. 
  todays: 
  - item: If you were expecting things to get more straightforward now that the president has officially been impeached, well, welcome to Thursday where things have most definitely <i>not</i> . The day started with the news that <b>Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi would delay delivering the articles of impeachment to the Senate</b>, which is necessary to trigger the trial of the president that marks the final phase of the impeachment process. "We are ready," to deliver the articles, Pelosi told press, but with no agreed-upon rules for the Senate trial, she was holding the articles back. "Until we can get some assurances from the majority leader that he is going to allow for a fair and impartial trial to take place," said Representative James Clybourn, "we would be crazy to walk in there." With only 51 votes in the Senate needed to establish the rules for the trial, which Republicans have without Democratic assistance, the belief is that by controlling the timing of delivery of the articles—which in turn controls the timing of the trial—it gives Democrats leverage on the process, like being able to get their witnesses called, that they may not otherwise have. It's a gamble, but, well, there's almost nothing to lose by trying.

  - item: If you're saying "Huh, I wonder how that went over with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell," the answer is <i>not well</i>. <b>Mitch McConnell took to the floor of the Senate today to decry the impeachment process and to rant about Nancy Pelosi's gambit.</b> Democrats, McConnell said in his speech, are "too afraid to even transmit their shoddy work product to the Senate." McConnell then accused the Democrats of getting "cold feet" while proceeding to basically make the argument that maybe he isn't up for a "fair and impartial" trial by saying that the process was "poisoned by partisanship," set a "toxic precedent," and that "if either of these articles is blessed by the Senate, we could easily see the impeachment of every future president of either party." He repeated warnings against the Senate "blessing" the impeachment—one assumes, by voting for it—two more times, which, well, uh, <i>looks at the bullet point above</i>.

  - item: Of course, maybe you are also wondering if Donald Trump would use the delay in delivery of articles of impeachment to <i>something something fake impeachment something</i>? Well, "<b>lawyers close to President Donald Trump are exploring whether House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to temporarily withhold articles of impeachment from the Senate could mean that the president hasn't actually been impeached</b>," Bloomberg reported today. In a press availability at the White House later, Trump said that "To me, it doesn’t feel like impeachment," because, he explained, it was a hoax. <i>Screams for an eternity.</i>

Of course, as the Washington Post points out, "Aside from impeachment votes, a bipartisan budget deal, and a vote on holding two Trump cabinet officials in contempt of Congress, Van Drew broke with the Trump administration on every major vote of 2019," but sure let's go with "undying support" sounds good Jeff.

  - item: Finally, even with question marks hanging around the articles of impeachment and the future of the impeachment trial in the Senate, <b>the DC Circuit Court of Appeals didn't hesitate to query whether the House was going to continue to pursue appeals on a pair of lawsuits tied up in the impeachment</b>. According to Politico, "Less than an hour after the first impeachment vote was gaveled to a close," the courts had issued a pair of orders asking the House to clarify if they still wanted the testimony of former White House Lawyer Don McGahn or access to portions of the Mueller investigation grand jury documents, now that their impeachment inquiry was done. Of course, the big question right now is simply&#58; <i>is it?</i> Currently, the appeals court is scheduled to hear arguments on these appeals on January 3. Gonna go ahead and bet that the House would like to continue to pursue the cases.

  yesterday: Just a little under three months ago, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/democrats-impeachment-trump.html">announced that the House was undertaking an impeachment inquiry</a> against the president after a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/read-the-whistleblower-complaint-regarding-president-trump-s-communications-with-ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelensky/4b9e0ca5-3824-467f-b1a3-77f2d4ee16aa/">whistleblower reported</a> that the president had solicited political favors from Ukraine <a href="https://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=6429015-Trump-Ukraine-Transcript">on a call</a> between Trump and Ukrainian president Zelensky back in July. From there, we saw a month of <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/11/05/trump-impeachment-witness-testimony-transcripts/4163983002/">closed-door depositions</a>—which had many witnesses <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/08/white-house-formally-tells-democrats-it-wont-cooperate-with-impeachment-probe-000279">blocked by the White House</a>—in October, followed by <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/everything-we-learned-trump-impeachment-hearings-n1089951">open hearings in November</a>, <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/Articles%20of%20Impeachment.pdf">articles of impeachment</a> were drawn up in December, and, today, a vote to impeach the president. Wow, it seems fast when you write it like that. Anyway…
  todays: 
  - item: <b>For only the third time in history, the President of the United States has been impeached.</b> After lengthy day of debate, the vote fell exactly as expected along an almost party-line split. Article I passed 230-197, with one present vote. Article II passed 229-198, again with one present vote. Two Democrats, Jeff Van Drew and Collin Peterson, voted against both articles. One Democrat, Jared Golden split his vote, yes on Article I, no on Article II. Democrat Tulsi Gabbard voted present because of course. No Republicans voted for impeachment. It's been a long day in a long week in a long few months in a long few years. But tonight, the president has been impeached.

  - item: The debate, which lasted for over eight hours (that is, once it actually began—the day opened with Republicans putting forth a motion to adjourn for the day, followed by a resolution to hold Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler in contempt, which, <i>stares</i>), was circular and repetitive. Over and over (<i>and over</i>) again, the arguments boiled down to&#58;<ul><li><b>For Republicans, impeaching the president was the end result of a nearly three year "political vendetta" against the president</b>, as House Minority Whip Steve Scalise said. By impeaching the president, Representative Will Hurd, argued, Democrats were setting "a dangerous precedent," and that impeachment would become "a weaponized political tool." Representative Doug Collins wrapped the Republican argument by saying that Democrats had disregarded rules in pushing through impeachment and that "chaos and mob rule" now reign. So, you know, chill stuff.</li><li>For Democrats, "the cameras of history" were rolling, as Representative Gregory Meeks said. <b>The historic nature of the vote—and the solemnity with which they approached it—defined the Democratic argument.</b> "Today, this day, we didn't ask for this. This is a sad day. It is not a day of joy," said Representative John Lewis, who knows something about history. But, he said, "when you see something that is not right, not just, not fair, you have a moral obligation to say something, to do something. Our children and their children will ask us&#58; 'What did you do?'" For 230 Democrats, <i>this is what they did.</i></li></ul>

  - item: With the back-and-forth between Democrats and Republicans taking up the brunt of the day (and of the last few weeks), it's worth taking a moment to understand the actual articles of impeachment on the day they were passed&#58;<ul><li><b>Article I&#58; Abuse of Power.</b> "Using the powers of his high office, President Trump solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, in the 2020 United States Presidential election" and "used the powers of the Presidency in a manner that compromised the national security of the United States and undermined the integrity of the United States democratic process."</li><li><b>Article II&#58; Obstruction of Congress.</b> "Donald J Trump has directed the unprecedented, categorical, and indiscriminate defiance of subpoenas issued by the House of Representatives" and, as a result, "abused the powers of the Presidency in a manner offensive to, and subversive of, the Constitution."</li></ul>The full resolution is only a few pages long and is worth a read today.

  - item: While Donald Trump is now only the third US president in history to be impeached, impeachment in the House of Representatives does not mean he's now out of office or can't run for reelection. Instead, <b>the impeachment process now moves to the Senate where a trial will be held in the New Year</b>. If convicted in that trial, which requires a 2/3 majority vote by the Senate, then the president would be removed from office. Of course, as of now, no president has ever been removed from office by a trial in the Senate.

  tomorrow: It's full-ish steam ahead to the Senate trial now. Of course, there's the entire winter holiday recess for lawmakers first. That said, before the week is up, I'd expect we'll know quite a bit more about the Senate trial, including when it actually will be and who Democrats will send to act as impeachment managers, essentially the prosecutors of the case. But tonight, let's all go to sleep OK?

  yesterday: With the vote on articles of impeachment happening tomorrow, much of yesterday was setting things up for that vote&#58; the Judiciary Committee <a href="https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/CRPT-116hrpt346.pdf">released a nearly 700-page report</a> documenting the charges against the president, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/15/conservative-groups-wage-war-on-impeachment-083396">intense campaigns</a> were waged against potentially-vulnerable Democrats, one House Democrat <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/12/16/jeff-van-drew-impeachment-gop-switch-staffers-quit/">prepared to become a Republican</a>, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/15/us/politics/trump-impeachment.html">sent a request</a> to Majority Leader McConnell that White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former White House National Security Advisor John Bolton testify in the all-but-inevitable-now Senate impeachment trial. And then there was today.
  todays: 
  - item: After over 10 hours of debate, <b>the House Rules Committee voted tonight along party lines, 9-4, to approve the parameters for tomorrow's historic vote on articles of impeachment in the House.</b> While most of those ten hours were spent revisiting the various arguments that we've heard repeatedly over the last few months—Democrats outlining how the President pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, Republicans condemning the impeachment process—the committee held their final vote just after 9pm Eastern. According to the rules passed, there will be six hours of floor debate tomorrow, with no additional procedural votes allowed. After that debate, the full House of Representatives will vote on each of the two articles of impeachment separately. This is <i>actually</i> happening.

  - item: Even while the rules for tomorrow's vote were still being set, the outcome became all but certain. One by one throughout the day, most members of a group of about 30 Democratic representatives, whose support for impeachment was in question, came forward to announce that they backed the vote, all but ensuring passage. While there are still 15 lawmakers who have not announced their votes, <b>at the point of this writing, 218 Democrats have come out in support of impeaching the president, over the majority necessary to pass the articles of impeachment.</b> Only 216 votes are needed, which means that, barring any surprises, by the end of the day tomorrow, the President of the United States will have been impeached for only the third time in history. The Washington Post has a live-updated look at the state of votes.

The rallies, organized by a coalition of progressive groups, "put a face to the majority of Americans that support impeachment and removal," said Sean Eldridge, one of the event organizers. Under the rallying cry of "Nobody is Above the Law," protestors filled New York's Times Square, the French Quarter in New Orleans, Boston Common, downtown Chicago, and many other places.

If you guessed "writing an unhinged six-page letter to Nancy Pelosi," congratulations you are correct.

  yesterday: After a lengthy debate last week, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/13/us/politics/impeachment-vote.html">House Judiciary Committee voted Friday morning</a> to approve <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/12/10/786579846/read-articles-of-impeachment-against-president-trump">two articles of impeachment</a>—"abuse of power" and "obstruction of Congress"—against President Trump and move them to the full House of Representatives for a historic vote to impeach the president. There are very few steps left, and they all happen this week. 
  todays: 
  - item: <b>The House Judiciary Committee today released a <i>658-page report</i> that explains in full detail the charges against the president in the two articles of impeachment approved by the committee last Friday.</b> The lengthy report cites extensive evidence and testimony collected over the course of the impeachment investigation to charge that the president engaged in "multiple federal crimes" including bribery and wire fraud. <i>Oh.</i>  The report also includes a 20 page dissent written by Republican ranking member Doug Collins who writes that the case is "weak" and "lowers the bar for future impeachments." Despite the minority dissent, the report concludes that President Trump "has placed his own interest in retaining power above our national security and commitment to self-governance," and that he "has done so before, he has done so here, and he will undoubtedly do so again." As a result, the report says, President Trump "should be impeached and removed from office." With this report done, the House Rules Committee will meet tomorrow to finalize the rules of engagement for a debate and final vote on articles of impeachment by the full House of Representatives on Wednesday.

  - item: With the final vote on impeaching the president just days away, attention has turned to 31 freshman Democratic House members who come from districts that voted for Trump in 2016 before they elected a Democrat in 2018. <b>A coalition of conservative groups are spending millions of dollars on TV and Facebook advertising targeting the districts of what they're calling the "Dirty 30."</b> Which sounds <i>gross</i>, tbh, and I'm never typing that again. The goal of the groups is to use the impeachment to mobilize voters against those candidates next November. Even Donald Trump Jr has gotten into the mix, tweeting out contact information for the 31 lawmakers and telling his followers to "call non-stop, tweet at them, tell them this will NOT STAND & you’ll remember in Nov." So, well, that's special.

For South Carolina Representative Joe Cunningham, "at the end of day, this is simply about the rule of law, whether we’re a country with laws or not and what type of precedent we want to set for future presidents." Michigan Representative Elissa Slotkin echoed the sentiment, saying "for me, this was an issue of principle. I felt it in my bones." With significant resources mobilized against them, speaking out in support of impeachment—let alone voting for it—comes with major downsides, and yet here they are.

In addition to the witnesses requested, Schumer also proposed a start date of January 7 for the impeachment trial. Of course, the Republicans are the majority party in the Senate, so Schumer's letter is really more of an opening volley in what he hopes will be a negotiation between the two parties. However, if McConnell can hold together 51 votes from the 53 Republicans in the Senate, they could simply set the trial rules without Democratic input. Which, well, <i>stares</i>.

"The committee has continued and will continue investigations," Democratic lawyers wrote in their filing, arguing that the need for those documents doesn't stop with the end of the impeachment process. With multiple appeals from the White House trying to block subpoenas by the House, one would expect that those investigations will actually stay open for quite some time.

That was the last step in a multi-month process before bringing a vote to the floor of the House of Representatives to impeach the president on two articles of impeachment, "abuse of power" and "obstruction of Congress." The vote will happen this week.  
  todays: 
  - item: It's the final week of business in 2019 for the House of Representatives, and the impeachment vote looms large. So what does the week look like? <ul><li>Even before we get to the impeachment vote, the House has two other major votes to hold this week&#58; spending bills to keep the government open past Friday and a vote on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the replacement to NAFTA. So, like, it's a pretty high-stakes week all around.</li><li>Impeachment-wise, first up will be a Tuesday debate and vote by the House Committee on Rules to decide on—guess what—the rules that will govern the final impeachment vote in the House. The Rules committee will decide "how long debate will last and how many amendments—if any—will be allowed," according to USA Today. The Rules committee has nine Democrats and four Republicans, so decisions will likely reflect that ratio.</li><li>Once the rules have been set, the House is free to hold a full floor debate and vote on impeachment of the president. Currently the expectation is that vote will be held on Wednesday, December 18th. How long and how bananas the debate is will be directed by the Rules Committee. The outcome of the vote is not particularly in question, as the Democrats hold a majority of seats in the House, 233-197. It's expect that, come the end of the vote, the president will be impeached.</li></ul>Once impeachment is done, everything moves over to the Senate for a trial that could result in the president's conviction—at which point he would be removed from office—or acquittal. No president has ever been convicted by the Senate. So, uh, there's that.

  - item: With a vote to impeach the president the likely outcome in the House, the biggest unknown is how many Democrats may vote <i>not</i> to impeach. According to Bloomberg, there are 31 House Democrats that represent districts that Trump won in 2016, potentially making a vote to impeach him politically risky. For some, like Staten Island Rep Max Rose, whose district voted for Trump by 54%, the vote is about "showing integrity and abiding by my oath the Constitution." Rose is expected to vote to impeach. Representative Elissa Slotkin says that among her constituents, there are "more people against than for." She hasn't revealed how she plans to vote. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has said that she will not be pressuring Democrats to vote for impeachment. "People have to come to their own decisions," she said.

The decision, according to the Washington Post, "came after Van Drew joined President Trump for a lengthy Friday meeting, during which Trump urged him to join the GOP." <i>Well.</i>  While Van Drew has yet to officially announce the switch, he's already being condemned by some in the party. "Jeff Van Drew has chosen his political career over our Constitution," New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said Saturday night. Murphy added that Van Drew was "willing to enable Donald Trump just to try to salvage his own election."

  - item: Once the vote to impeach passes the House, the Senate will hold a trial, where Senators serve as the jury. Republicans hold a slim majority in the Senate, but a vote to convict requires a 2/3 majority&#58; 67 votes, meaning that even if every Democrat voted to convict the president they would still need 20 Republican votes. As a result, things could end very quickly. That's exactly what Republican Senator Lindsay Graham would like to see, he said this weekend. "This thing will come to the Senate, and it will die quickly, and I will do everything I can to make it die quickly," Graham said at the Doha Forum on Saturday. Which, uh, seems like a weird thing for a juror to say. But then again, "I'm not trying to pretend to be a fair juror here," Graham explained. Well, <i>screams</i>.

- date: 2019-12-13T18:30:00
  yesterday: This week, <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/Articles%20of%20Impeachment.pdf">two articles of impeachment</a> against Donald Trump were introduced. Article one, abuse of power, says   the president misused the powers of his office in pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. Article two, obstruction of Congress, says that he then waged "unprecedented" defiance of the investigation into those actions. After a heated debate in the Judiciary Committee that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/us/politics/trump-impeachment.html">dragged on for a day and a half</a>, the articles of impeachment came up for a vote by the committee this morning. 
  todays: 
  - item: In stark contrast to yesterday's 14 <i>long</i> hours of debate, <b>the House Judiciary Committee only needed seven minutes today to vote to approve the two articles of impeachment against President Trump.</b> Splitting, as anticipated, straight down party lines, the 23-17 vote now moves the articles to the floor of the House of Representatives where it is expected to receive a vote next week. "For the third time in a little over a century and a half," Judiciary chair Jerry Nadler said, "the House Judiciary Committee has voted articles of impeachment against the president." The vote in the Judiciary Committee marked, according to Nadler, "a solemn and sad day." Of course, House Republicans disagreed, calling the vote a "political hit-job," according to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Whatever it is, it's history. The full House is expected to vote on impeachment next Wednesday. Hang on.

  - item: <b>How did the president respond to the news that articles of impeachment against him had been approved by the Judiciary Committee? With a threat.</b> "Someday they’ll be a Democrat president and they’ll be a Republican House, and I suspect they’re going to remember it," he told reporters during a press appearance with the president of Paraguay. <i>Sure, why not.</i> Trump then launched into attacks against the whistleblower ("a fraud") whose report kicked off the impeachment, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff ("a disgrace") who lead the impeachment investigation, and Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman ("another beauty") who testified in open hearings. The articles of impeachment against the president include using the power of the presidency to investigate political rivals for personal gain and obstructing congress by blocking and threatening witnesses, so like everything he said today is very cool.

  - item: Speaking of very cool things, <b>Rudy Giuliani—the president's personal lawyer whose continued efforts in Ukraine to uncover dirt against Democrats  is a major factor in the impeachment inquiry—spent the morning at the White House.</b> So that's, uh, <i>screams</i>. While what he was doing there is unknown, the Wall Street Journal today released an extensive look into Giuliani's actions in Ukraine covering all the way from 2016 to, uh, last weekend. When Giuliani "returned to New York last Saturday, the president called him as his plane was still taxiing down the runway," he told the Journal. "'What did you get?' he said Mr. Trump asked. 'More than you can imagine,'" Giuliani responded. So, well, <i>keeps screaming</i>.

  - item: If the House votes to impeach President Trump next week (which, because of the Democratic majority there, is very likely), things then move to the Senate where an impeachment trial will be held. Coordination between the White House and Republican Senators on that trial continues to get tighter. <b>Last night Senate Majority Leader appeared on Sean Hannity's Fox News show and pledged "total coordination" between Senate Republicans and the White House.</b> "There will be no difference between the president’s position and our position, as to how to handle this," he said. Senators play the role of the jury in an impeachment trial, so, well <i>even more screaming</i>.

  - item: Finally, <b>the Supreme Court today announced that they would take up three appeals from the president, putting his assertion of "absolute immunity" against subpoenas to the ultimate legal test.</b> The appeals are on subpoenas for tax and financial records filed by both the House of Representatives and the Manhattan District Attorney. In all of these cases, the president's lawyers have asserted that he has "absolute immunity" against subpoenas—the same assertion the White House has made in blocking witnesses in the impeachment investigation. Every ruling on this argument up to now has gone against the president and a Supreme Court ruling that followed suit would have huge repercussions. But don't expect a decision that will impact the looming impeachment&#58; The Supreme Court won't hear arguments until the end of March, and won't issue a decision until the end of June. That's just two months before the party conventions that mark the official start of the 2020 general election. So, uh. <i>Wow.</i>

  tomorrow: Unless something goes <i>wild</i>, next week the House of Representatives will impeach President Trump. That's a huge thing. In addition to that, we'll probably get a better sense of timing of the trial in the Senate that will be triggered by impeachment. And there will be <i>a lot</i> of angry tweeting and spin ahead of us too. This site will be updated mid-day Sunday to catch it all. TGIF, it's been a long week.

  yesterday: House Democrats <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/Articles%20of%20Impeachment.pdf">introduced two articles of impeachment against Donald Trump</a> on Tuesday. The first article covers "abuse of power"—the president "used the power of his high office" to solicit "the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine" in the 2020 election. The second covers "obstruction of congress"—the president waged an "unprecedented, categorical, and indiscriminate defiance of subpoenas" and as a result obstructed the investigation. Those articles <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/us/politics/judiciary-committee-impeachment-debate.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage">then went to the Judiciary Committee</a> for markup, debate, and a vote today. Except, well, maybe not that vote part. 
  todays: 
  - item: <b>After <i>14 hours</i> of debate in the Judiciary Committee today (which followed three hours of opening statements last night), chairman Jerry Nadler surprised pretty much everyone by postponing a final vote on articles of impeachment until tomorrow, Friday the 13th (<i>stares</i>).</b> Really, after 14 hours, <i>there was no vote</i>. On the plus side, if you are a fan of circular arguments, people that hate each other passive-aggressively saying "my friend," or the phrase "move to strike the last word," then today was really your day. For the rest of us, it was simply a very long day that began and ended in <i>exactly</i> the same place. From opening statements last night, through looping arguments debating five different amendments introduced by Republicans today, to what everyone thought were closing statements as midnight approached, the debate took on a Groundhog Day-like quality, except if Bill Murray never learned a single thing, <i>ever</i>. Despite the hours (<i>and hours</i>) of repetitive debate, already-hardened positions remained that way. For Democrats, the argument remained what it's been for weeks&#58; not only did the president abuse his position by using the power of his office to pressure Ukraine into investigating his political rivals for his own benefit, he is still trying to do so and  they must act accordingly. For Republicans, well, take your pick&#58; the process was unfair, Joe Biden did worse, Adam Schiff something or other, the Democrats can't win next year, oh and Hunter Biden smoked crack (<i>really</i>). After 14 hours of this, with no warning, chairman Nadler recessed the Committee until a final vote—almost certain to be along party lines—in the morning. People yelled. I was one of them. <i>I feel like I'm going to die.</i>

  - item: Once the articles have been approved by the Judiciary Committee tomorrow—<i>nobody jinx this, it is going to happen for real this time</i>—they move to the full House of Representatives for debate and a final vote next week. But while tomorrow's vote in the Judiciary is expect to fall cleanly along party lines, next week's may have a few defections. Currently, <b>Democrats are preparing for some members to vote <i>against</i> impeaching the president.</b> <i>Sure, why not.</i> According to the Washington Post, "Lawmakers and senior aides are privately predicting they will lose more than the two Democrats who opposed the impeachment inquiry rules package in late September." While it's unknown how many Democrats may vote against impeachment—or if any will at all (as with everything, nothing is done 'til it's done)—the Democrats have enough of a majority in the House that they could lose 17 votes and impeachment would still pass. They won't lose 17 votes.

  - item: With the outcome of a vote in the full House all but a foregone conclusion (though, so was a vote happening in Judiciary tonight, so what do I know), <b>Democratic House members are now looking toward the trial in the Senate and who will play the important roles of impeachment managers in the trial there.</b> Impeachment managers are essentially the prosecutors of the impeachment trial, making the case to the jury of Senators that the president should be convicted and removed from office. It's a high-profile gig and lots of people are jockeying for it, according to Politico&#58; "Several members have been seeking out Pelosi—even making a beeline for her on the House floor during votes—to deliver their in-person pitch." While House Intelligence chair Adam Schiff and Judiciary Committee chair Jerry Nadler are almost certainly going to be selected as managers, who else gets the tap is a growing side quest of speculation.

  - item: <b>The White House is gearing up for the Senate trial as well, sending White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland and counsel Pat Cipillone to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office today.</b> The meeting was to have "good close communication, conversation with Senate Republicans in the event the House goes ahead and actually produces articles of impeachment," Ueland told Bloomberg. Ueland declined to say whether calling witnesses were discussed, but White House spokesperson Stephanie Grisham earlier said that Trump would like to call "a lot" of them. <i>Save me.</i>

  - item: Finally, the question of witnesses in the impeachment trial is also a question of length, as calling witnesses would greatly extend the trial. As of right now, <b>Senate Republicans are leaning towards a short trial that would include no witnesses</b>, according to the Washington Post. "I would say I don’t think the appetite is real high for turning this into a prolonged spectacle,” Senate Majority Whip John Thune told the Post. The appetite may not be high, but by going with no witnesses, Senate Republicans "could clash with President Trump’s desire to stage a public defense of his actions toward Ukraine that would include testimony the White House believes would damage its political rivals," the Post writes. So, well, we'll see who wins that one. Guess. Just guess. <i>Screams</i>.

  tomorrow: After the marathon session in Judiciary today that ended with no vote, well obviously, first thing on the list is to actually vote these articles out of the committee. I for one am thrilled to spend another morning watching these people on TV. After that, I'd expect we find out when the impeachment vote will happen in the House and, perhaps, a few more details about the Senate trial in the coming days. Plus tweeting. Lots and lots of tweeting.

  yesterday: Yesterday, Tuesday, December 10, House Democrats made history by <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/Articles%20of%20Impeachment.pdf">introducing articles of impeachment against President Trump</a>, only the fourth time in US history that articles have been drawn up against a sitting president. You would think then that today would see Democrats continuing to make headlines as they sell their vision for impeachment. You would be mistaken. 
  todays: 
  - item: The biggest news in the impeachment today actually hasn't happened as of this update. Instead, <b>at 7pm Eastern tonight, the House Judiciary Committee will begin the process of debating the two articles of impeachment that were introduced yesterday.</b> "The rare evening session," the New York Times reports, "will give each of the 41 members of the committee a chance to argue for or against Mr. Trump’s impeachment. It could go late into the night." I mean, <i>that's certainly a choice</i>, who doesn't love a night of parliamentary procedures and points of order? After the late night, the Committee will reconvene Thursday morning to begin the markup process, where members can propose edits and amendments to the articles (expect the clownshow to be in full effect for this). Finally, once markup is finished—current expectation is Thursday afternoon—the Judiciary Committee will vote on the articles of impeachment and, assuming they pass, they'll move to the full House of Representatives at that point. If you're into watching people yell at each other late at night, or just curious which representative falls asleep in their chair first, maybe tune in tonight. Otherwise, Thursday's impeachment.fyi update will cover any highlights from tonight along with coverage of tomorrow's vote.

  - item: Beyond the debates to come tonight, Democrats have been largely absent from the news today but Republicans have been busy. <b>Jacketless representative, and member of the Judiciary Committee, Jim Jordan along with Republican counsel Stephen Castor met with Republican Senators today</b>, "another sign," the Washington Post reports, "that the probe’s center of gravity is soon moving to the other side of the Capitol building." Assuming that the House votes to impeach the president (which is likely because Democrats hold a commanding majority there), the impeachment process moves to the Senate for a trial. Which, according to Mitch McConnell will happen after New Year's. Whether Jordan was meeting to brief Senators on the process thus far or strategize on the trial to come is unknown. It's also unknown if Castor once again brought a grocery bag instead of a briefcase, as he did to Monday's Judiciary Committee hearing. <i>Sorry, not sorry.</i>

  - item: <b>Republican strategy for the trial in the Senate is still up in the air, but at least one House Republican would like them to take a harder line than they're currently signaling.</b> Representative Jim Banks wrote a letter today to Senator Lindsay Graham asking him to "rethink" his impeachment strategy. "The letter comes after Graham, a top Trump ally, rebuffed a number of the House GOP’s calls for hard-line tactics to defend Trump," writes Politico. Those "hard-line tactics"? Banks had previously written Graham asking him to subpoena the phone records of House Intelligence chair Adam Schiff. <i>Stares</i>. "It is urgent we fight fire with fire and tell them enough is enough," Banks wrote in today's letter which maybe seems like a <i>little</i> bit of hyperbole but hey, you do you. When Banks wrote Graham previously, Graham turned him down, explaining simply "we’re not going to do that." But, with so much about the Senate trial still unknown, I wouldn't bet against them doing that quite yet.

  - item: Finally, speaking of Republican Senators, <b>Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, told the Washington Post that President Trump has asked that he brief GOP Senators, along with the Justice Department, on what he found on his trip to Ukraine last week.</b> Sure, why not. "He wants me to do it," Giuliani told the Post, "I’m working on pulling it together and hope to have it done by the end of the week." Which, <i>what on earth is going on</i>. The Post points out that it's unclear if anyone actually <i>wants</i> Giuliani to brief them&#58; Lindsay Graham has previously said he doesn't plan to call Giuliani to testify to the Senate Judiciary Committee and Attorney General Bill Barr has "counseled Trump in general terms that Giuliani has become a liability and a problem for the administration." Despite being in the process of potentially being impeached in part because of Rudy Giuliani skulking around Ukraine, as recently as this weekend the President told reporters that he believed Giuliani would make a report from his trip. "He says he has a lot of good information," Trump said. Which, <i>screams forever</i>.

  tomorrow: After tonight's late-night debate in the House Judiciary Committee, tomorrow will see the markup/clownshow phase followed by a vote, probably in the afternoon, to send the articles of impeachment to the full House of Representatives. It's expected that they will pick up the debate quickly and vote sometime next week.

  yesterday: Back on September 24, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/democrats-impeachment-trump.html">announced that the House was undertaking an impeachment inquiry</a> against the president after a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/read-the-whistleblower-complaint-regarding-president-trump-s-communications-with-ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelensky/4b9e0ca5-3824-467f-b1a3-77f2d4ee16aa/">whistleblower reported</a> that the president had solicited political favors from Ukraine <a href="https://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=6429015-Trump-Ukraine-Transcript">on a call</a> between Trump and Ukrainian president Zelensky back in July. From that point, House investigative committees spent a month holding <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/11/05/trump-impeachment-witness-testimony-transcripts/4163983002/">closed-door depositions</a>—many of the subpoenas they sent during that time were <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/08/white-house-formally-tells-democrats-it-wont-cooperate-with-impeachment-probe-000279">blocked by the White House</a>. On Halloween, the House voted to move the impeachment to a new phase, starting with <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/everything-we-learned-trump-impeachment-hearings-n1089951">open hearings in November</a>, which concluded prior to the Thanksgiving recess. With the publication of a <a href="https://intelligence.house.gov/report/">300 page report</a> of the investigation and a week of <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?466833-1/judiciary-hearing-constitutional-framework-impeachment">legal panels</a> in the Judiciary Committee to kick off December, the House's impeachment inquiry moved to its final phase today.
  todays: 
  - item: Well, it's official&#58; <b>At a brief press conference this morning, House Democrats released the articles of impeachment against Donald Trump</b>. Despite everything that has happened or may happen, this is a big deal—it's only the fourth time in US history that impeachment articles have been drawn up against a sitting president. "Our president holds the ultimate public trust," House Judiciary Committee chair Jerry Nadler said before introducing the articles. "When he betrays that trust and puts himself before country, he endangers the Constitution, he endangers our democracy and he endangers our national security."  That betrayal, Nadler explained, lead Democrats to draft two articles of impeachment. The actual resolution is only nine pages long, but here's the quick two-bullet summary&#58;<ul><li>	<b>Article One&#58; Abuse of Power.</b> "Using the powers of his high office, President Trump solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, in the 2020 United States Presidential election" and "used the powers of the Presidency in a manner that compromised the national security of the United States and undermined the integrity of the United States democratic process."</li><li>	<b>Article Two&#58; Obstruction of Congress.</b> "Donald J Trump has directed the unprecedented, categorical, and indiscriminate defiance of subpoenas issued by the House of Representatives" and, as a result, "abused the powers of the Presidency in a manner offensive to, and subversive of, the Constitution."</li></ul>By introducing these two articles of impeachment, "unlike President Trump, we understand that our duty—first and foremost—is to protect the Constitution and to protect the interests of the American people,” Nadler said. “That is why we must take this solemn step today."

  - item: The introduction of articles of impeachment is only the first step in passing the articles by the full House. <b>The next step in the process will begin Wednesday evening in the House Judiciary Committee with opening statements followed by discussion, markup, probably quite a bit of shouting, and ultimately a vote by the Committee on Thursday.</b> Once that vote in the Judiciary Committee happens, and assuming the articles are passed, then it goes to the full House for a discussion (and more shouting) and then a final vote most likely before the end of next week—<i>which is, like, super soon.</i> For a good understanding of all that's to come, including a potential Senate trial, the Washington Post has put together a very nice flowchart. 
    source: Washington Post
    url: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/09/25/how-impeachment-works/
  - item: Assuming the articles of impeachment pass the full House, they then go to the Senate for an impeachment trial. However, <b>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday that a potential trial in the Senate will wait until after the winter recess</b>. I mean, <i>thank you?</i> "What is not possible, obviously, would be to turn to an impeachment trial … before we break for Christmas," McConnell told reporters today. Once the Senate reconvenes in 2020, however, McConnell said that he would expect that the trial would proceed with House managers making the case to convict the president and the president's lawyers making their defense. After that, McConnell said, "It could go down the path of calling witnesses and basically having another trial, or it could decide—and again 51 members could make that decision—that they’ve heard enough and believe they know what would happen and could move to vote on the two articles of impeachment." So we've all got <i>that</i> to look forward to once the New Year's ball drops.

  - item: Finally, <b>one thing that <i>may</i> be resolved before the new year is the lingering lawsuit filed by deputy national security advisor Charles Kupperman, which had a hearing today.</b> Kupperman filed suit back in October asking a judge to decide whether he should follow the House subpoena for him to testify or abide by the White House's directive that he not comply. While the House has since dropped their subpoena—saying that maneuvering the courts would take too long—Kupperman has continued to pursue the case, explaining today that he wants a definitive decision so he can't be held in contempt of Congress at a later date. Kupperman's lawyer also represents former national security advisor John Bolton, who has said he'd follow the ruling as well, which is really the bigger deal in all of this, no offense Charles. At today's hearing, Judge Richard Leon said he would have a decision by the end of the year. Happy New Year!

  tomorrow: Wednesday and Thursday belong to the Judiciary Committee's debate and vote on articles (early warning&#58; if they're really starting opening statements Wednesday night, they'll get rolled into Thursday's update because I'm not staying up just for that). From there, the articles of impeachment will go to the full House who are currently expected to pick them up for discussion and a final vote by the end of next week. In addition to that, the Supreme Court meets on Friday and will potentially decide if they're hearing two Trump appeals against subpoenas that could have further reverberations in the impeachment process. And, almost certainly, we'll get a lot of angry tweets—I'm already exhausted just thinking about those.

  yesterday: Drawing from last week's panel of law professors talking about the Constitution, over the weekend, the House Judiciary Committee <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-outline-constitutional-justification-for-trumps-impeachment-11575778352">released a report</a> outlining what the Committee believes are impeachable offenses. Previous versions of this report were drawn up for both the Nixon and Clinton impeachments, so it's clearly a signal of what's to come. Speaking of signals of what's to come, also over the weekend President Trump said that his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani had just returned from Ukraine and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-07/trump-says-giuliani-will-file-a-report-on-findings-from-ukraine?srnd=premium">wanted to present what he found to Congress</a>. So, well, <i>screams</i>. Anyway, that brings us to today.
  todays: 
  - item: The House Judiciary Committee held their second hearing in the ongoing impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump today. <b>Over nine <i>long</i> hours, the hearing featured the lawyers from the House Intelligence Committee—both Democratic counsel Daniel Goldman and Republican counsel Stephen Castor (who brought his notes in a reusable shopping bag)—making their respective cases for and against impeachment.</b> For Democrats, Goldman ran—once again—through the established narrative of the president's actions toward Ukraine. Republicans took more of a—uh—scattershot approach, questioning the process, the absence of Adam Schiff, and Joe Biden's actions toward Ukraine as Vice President. Did I mention that this hearing was <i>over nine hours long?</i> OK, let's look at the main arguments here&#58;
    source: 
    url: 
  - item: For Democrats, Goldman's 45 minute presentation was largely a run-through of the case that they made through two weeks of open testimony and the 300 page report that followed&#58; the president attempted to use the power of his office to pressure Ukraine into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival. However, <b>Democrats were quick to point out that this wasn't just about what the president did this spring and summer, he's still <i>actively</i> attempting to solicit Ukrainian help to influence the 2020 election.</b> "If you do not believe he won’t do it again," Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler said, "let me remind you that the president’s personal lawyer spent last week in Ukraine meeting with government officials in an apparent attempt to gin up the same so-called favors that brought us here today." I mean, that's <i>exactly</i> what Rudy Giuliani spent last week doing, so.

Me.</i> From the start of Castor's 45 minute presentation—which focused heavily on Joe, his son Hunter, and Hunter's seat on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma—to the many 5 minute rounds of member "questions," Biden was front and center. The Biden argument reached its nadir when, after playing clips from an ABC News interview with Hunter Biden, Republican Representative Steve Chabot declared, "You’re investigating the wrong guy, Mr. Chairman." <i>No, really&#58; Help. Me.</i> Representative Louie Gohmert went so far as to say, "Joe Biden—we're told, gee he may be the next president—well we've already got the forms, all we've got to do is eliminate Donald Trump's name and put Joe Biden's name in there." He added, "I'm scared for my country." <i>Stares</i>. Me too Louie, me too.

  - item: The other major point that Republicans made, <i>repeatedly</i>, today was that <b>they were very upset that the House Intelligence Committee report included phone record metadata that implicated Devin Nunes, the Republican ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, in having phone conversations with both Rudy Giuliani and Giuliani associate Lev Parnas.</b> I mean, I guess a guy could be pissed at Devin for making the calls in the first place, but instead over and over again Republicans wanted to know who decided to—in ranking member Doug Collins' words—play "match game" by connecting a phone number to Nunes. "We're not going to play cute here," Collins hollered at Goldman, "someone took the records, took those numbers and said, 'hey, let's play match game.'" Match Game was a game show that aired mostly in the 1960s and 70s. I know this because I just looked it up. Anyway, Representative Collins would very much like Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff, who he said must have ordered the phone records to be released, to explain himself—which is going to make for an awkward bowl of bean soup at the Capitol cafeteria sometime for sure.

  - item: But ultimately this hearing wasn't about Republicans' procedural complaints or their mock trial of the Biden family&#58; <b>It was about the Democrats making a closing argument that the president should be impeached.</b> Having spent the months of October and November investigating the president's actions in regards to Ukraine, as well as a single week in the Judiciary Committee looking into the legal ramifications of it all, the sense seems to be that their case is closed which, uh, <i>aaaaaaaahhhhh</i>??? Yes, <i>that.</i> Anyway, as he gaveled out the proceedings, Jerry Nadler said  that the president's "conduct is clearly impeachable. This committee will proceed accordingly." Of course, <i>proceed to what</i> is a little unclear— the theme of the entire Judiciary phase of the inquiry may as well be "next steps are unclear"—but current understanding is that the Committee may draft articles of impeachment by the end of the week. <i>That's like in two days.</i> Here we go.

  yesterday: Articles of impeachment against Donald Trump are officially being drafted. <a href="https://pelosi.house.gov/news/press-releases/pelosi-remarks-announcing-house-of-representatives-moving-forward-with-articles">Announced by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi on Thursday</a>, this starts what will be the final phase of the impeachment process in the House of Representatives. The articles will be drafted by the Judiciary Committee who will then vote on them and send them to the full House for debate and votes. All of this is, reportedly, going to happen <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democrats-consider-bribery-obstruction-for-impeachment-articles-against-trump/2019/12/05/b2e89686-1776-11ea-9110-3b34ce1d92b1_story.html">before the House breaks for winter recess</a>. Yipes. 
  todays: 
  - item: On Saturday, <b>the House Judiciary Committee released a report outlining what the Committee believes are impeachable offenses.</b> The report has historic significance, as it it's based on one first written during the Nixon impeachment and updated in the 90s for Bill Clinton. "The earlier reports remain useful points of reference," writes Judiciary Chair Jerry Nadler, "but no longer reflect the best available learning on questions relating to presidential impeachment." The report goes on to define what the committee considers impeachable treason ("a deliberate betrayal of the nation and its security"), bribery ("when the President offers, solicits, or accepts something of personal value to influence his own official actions"), and other high crimes and misdemeanors (divided into three broad categories&#58; abuse of power, foreign entanglements, and corruption of office and elections). While this report isn't the draft articles of impeachment, it's a roadmap straight to them. Here we go.

The Vice President's office has already refused, saying that "because Adam Schiff continues to operate in an underhanded manner, the Office of the Vice President does not even know what he wants declassified."

While he's lost every suit up to now, the stay puts that release on hold at least until this coming Friday when the Court will decide whether to hear the lawsuit. This is the second case that surrounds the administration's claim of "absolute immunity" from subpoena to reach the Supreme Court and it's likely they'll consider both Friday. If they do decide to hear the cases, expect the stay to be extended and for a decision to not come until next summer. <i>Screams into the void</i>.

  yesterday: Yesterday Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi moved the impeachment investigation into another new phase&#58; <a href="https://pelosi.house.gov/news/press-releases/pelosi-remarks-announcing-house-of-representatives-moving-forward-with-articles">the drafting of articles of impeachment</a>. The articles, which will be drafted by the Judiciary Committee potentially as soon as late next week, will then be voted on by the full House. Current best guess for when that will happen is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democrats-consider-bribery-obstruction-for-impeachment-articles-against-trump/2019/12/05/b2e89686-1776-11ea-9110-3b34ce1d92b1_story.html">prior to the House breaking for the winter holidays</a>. <i>Which is actually quite soon.</i> 
  todays: 
  - item: The day after Nancy Pelosi announced that the House was going to officially draft articles of impeachment against President Trump was… a quiet day? For the most part, it was remarkably so. That was, until the end, when <b>White House Counsel Pat Cipollone wrote to the House Judiciary Committee to say that the president would not be taking part in the rest of the impeachment hearings</b>. More than just turning down the invitation, Cipollone said that the Committee "should end this inquiry now and not waste even more time with additional hearings." But what does Pat <i>really</i> think? "Adopting articles of impeachment would be a reckless abuse of power by House Democrats and would constitute the most unjust, highly partisan and unconstitutional attempt at impeachment in our nation’s history." <i>OK then.</i> Cipollone ended his letter by quoting the president's tweet from yesterday—you know, like you do in legal documents—saying that "if you are going to impeach me, do it now, fast, so we can have a fair trial in the Senate."

  - item: So about that "fair" trial in the Senate. <b>Politico today did a lot of legwork talking with Republican Senators about their plans for the impeachment trial</b> they're almost certain to hold. Were they, as the president has demanded, considering calling House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff and Speaker Nancy Pelosi as witnesses? "Are we going to start calling House members over here when we don’t like what they say or do?" Senator Lindsay Graham responded. "I don’t think so." In fact, Politico reports that Republicans are attempting to defend the president without having the trial descend "into chaos or divide their caucus ahead of a tough 2020 cycle." The reason? The math is hard. "Calling controversial witnesses will require near lockstep party unity from 51 of the 53 Senate Republicans to make any procedural maneuvers, a tough task given the diverse views in the GOP, according to senators and aides." Of course, as they say, <i>things are fluid</i>, so we'll see when we see.

  yesterday: The House Judiciary Committee started the next phase of the impeachment inquiry yesterday with testimony from four Constitutional law professors about, well, impeachment. Over the course of nearly nine hours, the professors <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/03/trump-impeachment-inquiry-judiciary-committee">laid out an argument for impeaching the president</a> based both on historical intent and current precedent. While three of the four professors were in deep agreement one, who was chosen by Republicans, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/impeachment-hearings-live-updates/2019/12/04/b7cc7b4e-1682-11ea-a659-7d69641c6ff7_story.html#link-2M6JUMXMAMZWROGGY722LEEZJU">offered a dissenting view</a> that the process was being rushed. Well, whether or not things were rushed before, they may have hit lightspeed today.
  todays: 
  - item: It's official&#58; <b>Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi today announced that the House of Representatives will begin drafting articles of impeachment against Donald Trump.</b> "The President leaves us no choice but to act," she said, "because he is trying to corrupt, once again, the election for his own benefit." Her remarks, delivered outside her office in the Capitol, started with the opening lines of the Declaration of Independence and leaned heavily on quotes from the framers of the Constitution if you were wondering what level of Americana Gravity she was going for. "During the debate over impeachment at the Constitutional Convention," Pelosi said, "George Mason asked&#58; 'Shall any man be above justice?'" She answered quickly&#58; "In America, no one is above the law." President Trump has "engaged in abuse of power undermining our national security and jeopardizing the integrity of our elections," she said. And, as a result, "sadly, but with confidence and humility, with allegiance to our Founders and our hearts full of love for America, today, I am asking our Chairmen to proceed with articles of impeachment." Articles are drafted by the Judiciary Committee and then debated and voted on in the full House, so this is the very beginning of the big one. Hold on to yer butts.

  - item: While Speaker Pelosi's remarks left a lot unanswered—she gave no timeline or sense of what charges may be pursued—additional reporting has fleshed out our sense of what's coming. According to the Washington Post, <b>"House Democrats are considering articles of impeachment against President Trump that include obstruction and bribery but are unlikely to pursue a treason charge."</b> In terms of timing, the Post reports that the current plan is to hold a floor vote "before Christmas," which, <i>looks at words, looks at calendar, falls on floor</i>. Of course, "the situation remains fluid"—I'd say so—and "discussions about the articles are ongoing."

  - item: <b>How did President Trump take the news? Pretty much exactly how you'd expect&#58; by lashing out on Twitter.</b> "The Do Nothing Democrats had a historically bad day yesterday in the House. They have no Impeachment case and are demeaning our Country. But nothing matters to them, they have gone crazy," he wrote this morning. "Therefore I say," he continued, "if you are going to impeach me, do it now, fast, so we can have a fair trial in the Senate." If you wondered what he meant by a "fair" trial, you only had to wait until the next tweet&#58; "We will have Schiff, the Bidens, Pelosi and many more testify, and will reveal, for the first time, how corrupt our system really is." <i>Help.

Both appeals concern subpoenas to Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA, who Trump sued to stop from complying. <i>You know, like you do.</i> The White House has lost all their appeals on these cases up to now, along with multiple other cases concerning what the administration contends is "absolute immunity" against subpoenas.

  yesterday: The House Intelligence Committee <a href="https://intelligence.house.gov/report/">released a 300 page report</a> based on the last two months of the impeachment investigation. The result? The president "<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/12/03/takeaways-house-intelligence-committees-impeachment-report-trump/">viewed himself as unaccountable and determined to use his vast official powers to secure his reelection</a>" while also obstructing the investigation into his actions at a level that made him "<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/12/impeachment-report-trump-obstruct/602938/">the first President in the history of the United States to seek to completely obstruct an impeachment inquiry.</a>" Alright then. That report, which was voted on by the committee last night, was then turned over to the House Judiciary Committee who, this morning, got the impeachment ball rolling again.
  todays: 
  - item: Public impeachment hearings got underway again today with—<i>checks watch</i>—nearly nine hours of testimony by four constitutional law professors about, well, constitutional law. <i>Really, that was the testimony.</i> <b>The first hearing held by the House Judiciary Committee was about establishing an understanding of what the Constitution says about impeachment and how some of the ambiguities in the text (what constitutes a "high crime," or "misdemeanor" for example) might be interpreted today.</b> The law professors assembled—Noah Feldman from Harvard, Michael Gerhardt from the University of North Carolina, Pamela Karlan from Stanford, and Jonathan Turley from George Washington University—did their best to answer both the 90 minute questioning session (45 minutes for Democratic counsel, 45 minutes for Republican) as well as for the 5 minute rounds for the 41—<i>forty one</i>—members of the Judiciary committee. What did we learn? Well, uh, that the president likely committed a series of impeachable offenses, unless you are a Republican congressperson in which case Adam Schiff, whistleblower, something something. In other words, we're pretty much where we were yesterday.

  - item: Three of the professors—Feldman, Gerhardt, and Karlan—were unequivocal in their assessment that Trump had committed impeachable offenses in both his demand for political favors from Ukraine and his obstruction of the investigation into his actions. <b>"If what we’re talking about is not impeachable, then nothing is impeachable," Professor Gerhardt testified. "If Congress fails to impeach here, then the impeachment process has lost all meaning and, along with that, our constitution’s carefully crafted safeguards against the establishment of a king on American soil."</b> While all three professors to come down on the side of impeachment were chosen by Democrats on the Judiciary committee, Stanford law professor Karlan was quick to point out that this wasn't about partisan politics, it was about the Constitution. "The Constitution of the United States does not care whether the next President of the United States is Donald J Trump or any one of the Democrats," she testified, "what the Constitution cares about is that we have free elections."

  - item: The one professor on the panel chosen by Republicans, Jonathan Turley, was less quick to call for impeaching the president—however, he also wouldn't entirely rule it out. Instead, <b>Turley felt that the process had been rushed. "Fast and narrow is not a good recipe for impeachment," he testified. "Impeachments are like buildings. There's a ratio between your foundation and your height. And this is the highest structure you can build."</b> Turley's assessment was that with so many fact witnesses blocked from testifying by the White House, that House investigators should be spending more time in court before proceeding with impeachment in order to prove whether the president's actions were either "obnoxious" or "impeachable."

  - item: Surprisingly, the Judiciary Committee hearing ended today without clear next steps—there are no more hearings currently scheduled nor a timeline for drawing up articles of impeachment. However, <b>House Democrats met earlier today in a private meeting—no aides, staff, or even phones were allowed in—to discuss the impeachment proceedings.</b> According to Politico, halfway through the meeting Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi asked "Are you ready?" to which the response was "Yes." But, at least for now what they are ready for isn't entirely clear. "We'll see," House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said, "it depends on what the Judiciary Committee does." Of course, as of this writing, the Judiciary Committee is doing nothing so <i>shruggie guy emoji</i>.

  yesterday: After taking Thanksgiving off, the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump moved into its next phase yesterday, with the announcement of the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-02/four-impeachment-scholars-to-open-judiciary-impeachment-hearing">lineup of law professors</a> (no, really) who will kick off the Judiciary Committee's first public impeachment hearing on Wednesday. In addition, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/30/intelligence-committee-draft-ukraine-report-074518">Democrats got to work</a> circulating their impeachment report (more on that below) while Republicans <a href="https://republicans-oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-02-Report-of-Evidence-in-the-Democrats-Impeachment-Inquiry-in-the-House-of-Representatives.pdf">went ahead and published</a> their rebuttal. What was in the Democrats' report? Well, glad you asked… 
  todays: 
  - item: After two months of investigations, including two weeks of public hearings, <b>the House Intelligence Committee released their impeachment inquiry report today</b>. Across 300 pages, the Committee extensively documents how President Trump "was withholding officials acts" (military aid and a White House visit for Ukraine) "while soliciting something of value to his reelection campaign—an investigation into his political rival." On top of that, the report says that Trump also obstructed the investigation into those actions, in fact, the report says, Trump is "the first President in the history of the United States to seek to completely obstruct an impeachment inquiry." <i>Oh, OK then</i>. The report—which is both very long and very damaging—was approved by the Intelligence Committee on Tuesday night along—<i>surprise surprise</i>—party lines, 13-9. The report will now move to the Judiciary Committee where they'll use it as evidence toward potentially drafting articles of impeachment. 
    source: original document

  - item: <b>The first half of the report, "The President’s Misconduct," lays out the entirety of the president's actions in Ukraine.</b> It's all in there&#58; from forcing out the US ambassador and replacing her, essentially, with Rudy Giuliani and US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland, to Giuliani's behind-the-scenes investigation of Joe Biden's son and the Ukraine/2016 election conspiracy theory, to the hold placed on military aid to Ukraine, to the "favor" the president asks for on the July 25 call, to the reverberations of that call that eventually lead to this very report, to the—<i>it's a lot.</i> Seeing it all laid out so clearly—in a complete, complex narrative built with testimony, texts, tweets, emails, and more—is pretty dramatic. The extensive research offered in the report paints a portrait of "a president who viewed himself as unaccountable and determined to use his vast official powers to secure his reelection." In fact, Trump's determination is undeterred, the report says, and "given the proximate threat of further presidential attempts to solicit foreign interference in our next election, we cannot wait to make a referral until our efforts to obtain additional testimony and documents wind their way through the courts." <i>Oh.</i>

  - item: <b>The second part of the report, "The President's Obstruction of the House Of Representatives' Impeachment Inquiry" makes the case that the president obstructed the impeachment investigation at historically unparalleled levels.</b> The section dedicates <i>dozens</i> of pages to the many attempts by the House to compel testimony from administration officials and the extent the White House went to block them. Alongside that, it compiles the hundreds of times the president threatened and intimidated witnesses via tweet, interview, and press gaggle. Finally, it offers a history lesson&#58; After looking at the ways previous presidents complied (or didn't) with impeachment investigations, the report concludes that "Donald Trump is the first and only President in American history to openly and indiscriminately defy all aspects of the Constitutional impeachment process, ordering all federal agencies and officials categorically not to comply with voluntary requests or compulsory demands for documents or testimony." I mean, it checks out.

This is the third court case in as many weeks to find that the White House's insistence on "absolute immunity" from Congress isn't valid. And, like those others, this one will be appealed to the Supreme Court.

  yesterday: November saw two weeks of public impeachment hearings held by the House Intelligence Committee. Over the course of the hearings, a dozen witnesses testified about <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/11/22/everything-new-we-learned-since-start-public-testimony-impeachment-inquiry/">the circumstances surrounding</a> interactions the president and other administration officials had with the new president of Ukraine and the potential that those interactions included <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/gordon-sondland-accuses-president-bribery">attempting to pressure Ukraine</a> into investigating the president's political rivals in return for a visit to the White House and the release of halted military aid. Those hearings wrapped up prior to the House's Thanksgiving recess and with them, the first public phase of the impeachment inquiry came to a close. But, with the start of a new month, a new phase began today.
  todays: 
  - item: After a week off for Thanksgiving, work begins again on the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. After a November dominated by public hearings held by the House Intelligence Committee, <b>the focus for December now shifts to the House Judiciary Committee, which will start holding open hearings <i>this</i> Wednesday.</b> Since this phase is about drafting articles of impeachment, not about investigating potential impeachable offenses, the focus of these hearings is apparently going to be quite different. How different? Well, Wednesday kicks off with four law professors who, according to Bloomberg, will offer an "opportunity to discuss the historical and constitutional basis of impeachment." <i>I mean, OK</i>? What happens with the inquiry after Wednesday's professorial hearing is actually still unclear—there's currently no schedule after Wednesday. Which, I'm sorry, <i>what?</i>

  - item: The lack of clarity of the impeachment process from here was the focus of a letter written by White House counsel Pat Cipollone to the Judiciary Committee chair Jerry Nadler on Sunday night. <b>Nadler, Cipollone writes, "provided no information whatsoever as to the dates these hearings will occur, what witnesses will be called, what the schedule will be, what the procedures will be, or what rights, if any, the Committee intends to afford the President"</b> I mean, there is <i>currently nothing scheduled after Wednesday</i>, so like he's not <i>wrong</i> here. Anyway, Trump's lawyer says that he won't be participating in Wednesday's hearing, but won't rule out future participation if they're ever told what they're participating in. Again, not an entirely indefensible position to take—which feels weird to write, but here we are.

  - item: Part of what's holding up next steps is that the impeachment process Democrats laid out requires the House Intelligence Committee to write a report summarizing their investigations from the last few months and deliver it to the Judiciary Committee, who will then consider the evidence in the report and decide if they'll draft articles of impeachment. But <b>the Intelligence Committee report was only just completed today and is now being circulated in draft form among committee members.</b> From there, according to Politico, they will vote on it and pass it along to the Judiciary Committee. So, at best, the Judiciary Committee will receive the report tomorrow afternoon for hearings that begin on Wednesday which sure feels like odd planning but hey, <i>shruggie guy emoji</i>.

Its findings are what you might expect&#58; <i>nothing to see here</i> across 110 pages. The Democrats' case, Republicans say, is based on "hearsay, presumption and emotion," with a "predetermined outcome" and also Democrats "flatly disregard any perception of potential wrongdoing with respect to Hunter Biden’s presence on the board of Burisma Holdings or Ukrainian influence in the 2016 election," which, <i>screams forever</i>.

  - item: While there's a remarkable amount we don't know about what happens next, one thing we do know is that <b>House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer announced today that the House will be open for business the week of December 16 with votes scheduled for the 17-20th.</b> While this wasn't an unexpected move—the government is only funded to the 20th, so they'll definitely be voting on <i>that</i>—it's also exactly the timeline previously floated for potential floor discussion and votes on impeaching the president so, well, here we go.

  yesterday: Yesterday we learned what happens next in the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump&#58; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-26/house-to-open-next-trump-impeachment-phase-with-dec-4-hearing?srnd=premium">it moves to the House Judiciary Committee</a>, which will hold its first public hearing on December 4th. Additionally this week, White House lawyers have been fighting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/27/us/politics/trump-legal-strategy.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage">multiple judicial decisions</a> against their assertion that administration officials have "absolute immunity" over congressional subpoenas, which is definitely when you know it's going well. Anyway, for being a short week before a national holiday and long weekend, it's been surprisingly busy.
  todays: 
  - item: <b>With yesterday's announcement that the impeachment inquiry is moving to its next phase after the Thanksgiving recess, the White House is left with a choice&#58; to cooperate or not.</b> This phase of the process, which moves to the House Judiciary Committee, is focused on evaluating evidence and drafting articles of impeachment. A major difference from the first phase of the inquiry is that it includes the opportunity for the administration to participate, including cross-examining witnesses and presenting a defense. Despite the oft-repeated talking points about being denied due process and not being able to defend themselves, now that the door is open, it's reported that the White House <i>still</i> may not take part. Shocking, I know. According to the New York Times, those involved in the decision "are deeply suspicious of taking part in a process they view as unfair." Of course, one way to make the process fairer would be to engage with it, but <i>shruggie emoji</i>. The White House has until 6pm Sunday to decide.

  - item: Meanwhile, today we learned more from yesterday's release of the testimony of Mark Sandy, deputy associate director for national security programs at the Office of Management and Budget. According to the Washington Post, <b>Sandy told investigators that "two officials at the White House budget office resigned this year partly because of their concerns about President Trump’s decision to hold up congressionally approved security assistance to Ukraine."</b> The hold on aid to Ukraine is a central part of the impeachment inquiry and while so far investigators have not directly connected the hold with the president's demand that Ukraine investigate his political rivals, they have also not been able to uncover any <i>actual</i> reason why the aid was withheld. That people within the White House's own budget office were quitting over it certainly underscores just how irregular the hold was.

Which, <i>waves hands in all directions</i>. While it appears that money never exchanged hands, "negotiations proceeded far enough that legal agreements were drafted under which Giuliani’s company would have received more than $200,000 to work for the Ukrainians," the Post reported. Sure, why not.

  - item: This latest revelation about Giuliani comes after a week where his partner Lev Parnas announced he had shared documents with the impeachment inquiry, and reports came out that federal investigators were issuing subpoenas for information on Giuliani's business dealings.

When asked by O'Reilly what Giuliani was doing in Ukraine then, Trump replied that "you'd have to ask that to Rudy" and that "Rudy has other clients, other than me." While Trump didn't explicitly disavow Giuliani—he told O'Reilly that Rudy was "a warrior"—it's a very curious turn by the president considering there have been two weeks of public testimony directly connecting him with Giuliani's actions in Ukraine. But sure, let's go with he was freelancing. <i>Why not?</i>

  yesterday: The first public phase of the impeachment inquiry came to a close last week after <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/11/22/everything-new-we-learned-since-start-public-testimony-impeachment-inquiry/">two weeks of testimony by a dozen witnesses</a>. Yesterday, House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/25/politics/adam-schiff-letter-impeachment-timeline/">announced that the committee was compiling a report</a> containing the evidence gathered thus far and would be turning it over to the Judiciary Committee for the start of the next phase. Today, we learned when that would begin. 
  todays: 
  - item: The next phase of the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump now has a start date&#58; December 4. <b>With the conclusion of hearings by the Intelligence Committee, impeachment work now moves to the House Judiciary Committee, which will start open hearings next Wednesday.</b> <i>That's really soon.</i> This new phase will be different than the public hearings that just ended, as the Judicial Committee is charged with deciding articles of impeachment, not on investigation. Another big change from last time is that the president will be able to have counsel cross examine witnesses. "The president has a choice to make," Judicial Committee chair Jerry Nadler said today, "he can take this opportunity to be represented in the impeachment hearings, or he can stop complaining about the process." One of the president's regular complaints is that he hasn't had representation in the hearings, so this fixes that, but the idea that he'll stop complaining about the process sounds far less likely. Either way, December 4, save the date!

And, you know, if the president was making a <i>truly</i> genuine offer, maybe there wouldn't have been administration lawyers spending their pre-holiday days in court fighting against congressional subpoenas on multiple fronts. But sure, you know, the president said it so, <i>stares off into the middle distance</i>.

  - item: Meanwhile, back in this reality, administration lawyers spent their pre-holiday days in court fighting against congressional subpoenas on multiple fronts. First, <b>lawyers from the Department of Justice have asked District Court Judge Kentanji Brown Jackson to put her ruling from yesterday—which found that the White House could not stop members of the administration from testifying to Congress—on hold so they can appeal it to the US District Court of Appeals</b>. In her ruling, Judge Jackson said that the administration argument of "absolute immunity" against congressional subpoenas was "baseless" and that "Presidents are not kings." If the ruling stands, former White House counsel Don McGahn would be compelled to testify and it could give the green light to other administration officials to follow suit as well. However, it will likely get tied up in appeals for some time because that's a pattern we've seen repeatedly at this point <i>including today in another case</i>, but please tell me again how much the president would "love" all his men to testify.

The Supreme Court has given them until December 5th to file that appeal. Man, I could have sworn that the president just today said he would <i>love</i> for people to be—<i>oh forget it</i>.

Now, you'd think that yesterday's ruling by Judge Jackson, who declared that presidents "do not have subjects, bound by loyalty or blood, whose destiny they are entitled to control," would have decided that. But <b>today Bolton's lawyers said that Jackson's ruling didn't apply to Bolton because of the national security aspects of his job.</b> <i>Stares</i>. "Any passing references in the McGahn decision to presidential communications concerning national security matters are not authoritative," his lawyer said in a statement.

At the Budget Office, Sandy testified, nobody knew why $400M in aid to Ukraine had been put on hold, only "that the president is directing a hold" on it. And at the State Department, it struck Reeker as "irregular" that the US ambassador to the EU was involved in Ukraine affairs (Ukraine is not in the EU). But, he added "If that was the choice of the President and the Secretary, then obviously, that was their choice." It sure was.

  yesterday: Two weeks of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump wrapped up last week. Over the course of the hearings, a dozen witnesses testified about <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/11/22/everything-new-we-learned-since-start-public-testimony-impeachment-inquiry/">the circumstances surrounding interactions the president and other administration officials had with the new president of Ukraine</a> and the potential that those interactions included <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/gordon-sondland-accuses-president-bribery">attempting to pressure Ukraine into investigating the president's political rivals in return for a visit to the White House and the release of halted military aid</a>. While the hearings seemed to wrap last week, next steps were left unclear. That is, until today. 
  todays: 
  - item: House Intelligence Committee Chair <b>Adam Schiff put to rest any question of what happens next with the impeachment inquiry in a letter sent to House colleagues today, saying that a report summarizing the inquiry's findings is underway and will be sent to the House Judiciary Committee "soon after Congress returns from the Thanksgiving recess."</b> But wait, aren't there like—<i>waves hands in all directions</i>—things that could still be investigated? Well yes, and Schiff isn't writing that off&#58; "While we will continue with our investigative work and do not foreclose the possibility of further depositions or hearings," he writes, "we will not allow the President or others to drag this out for months on end in the courts." Besides, Schiff says, "the evidence of wrongdoing and misconduct by the President that we have gathered to date is clear and hardly in dispute. What is left to us now is to decide whether this behavior is compatible with the office of the Presidency, and whether the Constitutional process of impeachment is warranted." So with that, once they receive the report, the Judiciary Committee will consider the evidence and, most likely, draft articles of impeachment in the coming weeks. Here we go—again. 
    source: CNN
    url: https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/25/politics/adam-schiff-letter-impeachment-timeline/
  - item: Even while Schiff is drafting his report, a big ruling came down this evening about the administration's stance of "absolute immunity" against congressional subpoenas that could have big repercussions on the impeachment inquiry. The short version? <b>The White House's "claim to unreviewable absolute testimonial immunity" is "baseless, and as such, cannot be sustained."</b> The ruling, from Federal District Court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, comes on a case House Democrats have been pursuing since the Mueller investigation. While the original lawsuit was about compelling the testimony of then-White House counsel Don McGahn, Judge Jackson's ruling was much broader, stating that the law applied to "other current and former senior-level White House officials" as well. Judge Jackson's ruling could have massive implications on the current impeachment proceedings, considering that the White House has blocked many relevant witnesses from testifying, including Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, former National Security Advisor John Bolton, former Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and many others. Of course, this ruling is almost certainly going to be appealed to the Supreme Court so maybe Adam Schiff has a point about the White House dragging this out "for months on end in the courts." But at least on paper, it's a big win for the rule of law.

  - item: What's at stake in this lawsuit was underlined once again today in a <b>Washington Post report that an administration review of the president's decision to withhold aid from Ukraine has "turned up hundreds of documents that reveal extensive efforts to generate an after-the-fact justification for the decision and a debate over whether the delay was legal."</b> This internal review was undertaken because of the impeachment inquiry and White House lawyers are now "expressing concern that the review has turned up some unflattering exchanges and facts that could at a minimum embarrass the president." If only there was a way of legally requiring these documents be turned over to congressional investigators. <i>Thinking face emoji</i>.

  - item: Speaking of turning things over to congressional investigators, ABC News is reporting that <b>Lev Parnas, an associate of Rudy Giuliani's who was arrested last month in part over his work in Ukraine, has turned over photos, audio, and video to the House Intelligence Committee.</b> <i>Oh</i>.  Parnas's lawyer said that "his evidence and potential testimony is non-partisan, and not intended to be part of a battle between the left and the right, but rather an aid in the determination by our government of what is in the best interests of our nation." Which I mean OK, but <i>what is on those tapes?</i> For now, we don't know.

  - item: Finally, the federal investigation into Parnas and his partner Igor Fruman is potentially moving on to a much larger target&#58; Rudy Giuliani. <b>According to the Wall Street Journal, recent subpoenas in the federal investigation that caught Parnas and Fruman "suggest that prosecutors are looking closely at the work of Mr. Giuliani himself."</b> The subpoenas, according to the Journal, cover an extensive list of potential charges&#58;  "obstruction of justice, money laundering, conspiracy to defraud the United States, making false statements to the federal government, serving as an agent of a foreign government without registering with the Justice Department, donating funds from foreign nationals, making contributions in the name of another person or allowing someone else to use one’s name to make a contribution, along with mail fraud and wire fraud." Giuliani, of course, denies any wrongdoing, saying, "There’s obviously a concerted effort to spread as many lies about me as possible, to destroy my reputation so that I’m not credible when I continue to reveal all of the massive evidence of criminality by the Bidens." Which, <i>screams</i>.

Over the last two weeks, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/11/22/everything-new-we-learned-since-start-public-testimony-impeachment-inquiry/">a dozen witnesses have testified</a> about extensive interactions with Ukraine over the spring and summer by both administration officials and people like Rudy Giuliani acting on behalf of the president and how those interactions lead to pressuring the Ukrainians to get them to investigate the President's political rivals. While it's not entirely clear what happens next (see the final bullet of today's update for more on that), what's happened up to now has been remarkable.
  todays: 
  - item: The weekend got off to a surprisingly impactful start with <b>the release of 100 pages of documents relevant to the impeachment investigation from the State Department on Friday night</b>. The documents, which were acquired via FOIA by the watchdog group American Oversight, show "multiple contacts" between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani this spring—exactly the time Giulaini was conducting a "smear campaign" against then-ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich. The documents, which were released by the State Department after a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by American Oversight, also include two conspiracy-heavy dossiers on Joe Biden's work in Ukraine enclosed in Trump Hotel folders that were addressed to Secretary of State Pompeo and were sent from the White House. So like, <i>brain actually explodes</i>.

  - item: Friday night continued to be a rough one for Giuliani, when CNN reported that a lawyer representing Giuliani associate Lev Parnas—who was arrested at Dulles Airport last month on charges stemming in part from his work in Ukraine—said that <b>his client was willing to tell Congress about meetings Rep Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, had with former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Victor Shokin last December in Vienna</b>. <i>Wait, what??</i> Parnas's lawyer, Joseph Bondy, went on to tell CNN that Parnas was "willing to comply with a Congressional subpoena for documents and testimony as part of the impeachment inquiry in a manner that would allow him to protect his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination." Which, <i>exploded brain explodes again</i>. Nunes has threatened to sue CNN over the allegations.

The Washington Post also connected a Nunes aide with "a group that met frequently in spring 2019 at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, to discuss the Biden matter." That group, according to Parnas's lawyer, included Giulini, Parnas, Lev Fruman (who was arrested with Parnas last month), and two lawyers. I wonder if they used Trump hotel folders for their dossiers? <i>Even more brain explosions.</i>

Which certainly seemed like maybe the most bonkers thing he could say until he added "If I disappear, it will appear immediately along with my RICO chart." <i>Brain exploding back and forth, forever.</i>

  - item: With this <i>impossibly</i> bananas weekend in the background, House Intelligence chair Adam Schiff went on CNN's State of the Union today to answer lingering questions on what happens next in the impeachment inquiry. The answer? It appears that he's taking a two-pronged approach&#58; taking all "the time that's necessary" to compile a report for the Judiciary Committee—which will be in charge of the next phase—but "we may have other depositions and hearings to do" in the Intelligence Committee because "we've continued to learn new information every day and I think that's going to continue." <i>Do you think so?</i> As a result, Schiff said, they may be making addendums and additions to any report they supply to the Judiciary Committee. Seems messy but you do you Adam.

  yesterday: This phase of the House impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump may (seriously, <i>we don't actually know</i>) have come to a close yesterday after two weeks of open testimony with the final two witnesses. But what witnesses they were! Fiona Hill, former senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council, explained about the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/us/politics/impeachment-hearing.html">"domestic political errand"</a> that the president sent US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland on, while David Holmes, a State Department official who works at the US Embassy in Ukraine, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/live-blog/nov-21-impeachment-hearings-live-updates-n1087686/ncrd1088436#liveBlogHeader">reenacted the phone call he overheard</a> between the president and Sondland. And then it was over (again&#58; ???) and the big question is, like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XdAQpq_1Xw">Buffy musical episode</a> asks, "where do we go from here?"
  todays: 
  - item: When Adam Schiff gaveled yesterday's Intelligence Committee to a close yesterday, he did so leaving questions unanswered&#58; Will more witnesses be called? Will they pursue administration officials who have defied subpoenas? Whatever happened to the president's offer to submit written testimony? Is this the end of this phase of impeachment hearings? Today didn't bring clarity to any of those questions, <b>but there are some indications that perhaps there are <i>new</i> questions emerging at the House Judiciary Committee who—if this really is the end of this phase—will be picking up the impeachment baton</b>. According to the Wall Street Journal, those questions include <i>tiny</i> details like "how the Judiciary Committee wants to handle hearings," which, like, you'd think they'd have thought of before now but who hasn't done an all-nighter before the big test right? Anyway, the Journal offers a potential timeline from here, that includes hearings and a vote in the Judiciary Committee the first two weeks of December, followed by floor debate over articles of impeachment that could "consume the entire week of December 15" and a vote "shortly before Christmas." <i>Ho ho nooooooo</i>.

  - item: Nature may abhor a vacuum, but the President of the United States loves one and moved quickly to fill the void left by the absence of impeachment hearings today. <b>President Trump gave a rambling, 53 minute interview on—where else—Fox & Friends this morning where he lashed out at many of the witnesses in the impeachment proceedings.</b> David Holmes' overheard phone call? "I guarantee you that never took place," Trump said (Gordon Sondland corroborated the call in his testimony). Gordon Sondland? "Hardly know him," Trump explained (Sondland donated a $1M to the Trump inaugural committee). Former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch? She said "bad things about me. She wouldn’t defend me." (<i>Stares</i>.)  He went on to say that he knows the identity of the whistleblower and continued to spread the now thoroughly-debunked theory that Ukraine "hated me. They were after me in the election." So, you know, it went real well.

Bolton, who has defied a subpoena to appear in the impeachment proceedings and who has been namechecked repeatedly in testimony the last two weeks, tweeted that he had "liberated the Twitter account, previously suppressed unfairly in the aftermath of my resignation as National Security Advisor." He ended two different tweets with "stay tuned........" and "More to come....."—you'd better believe I copy/pasted those periods <i>exactly</i>—so clearly there's going to be some mustachioed drama to come.

  yesterday: Open hearings in the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump hit high gear this week with <i>two</i> eleven-hour days of testimony. Over those 22 hours, we <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/impeachment-hearing-11-19-19">learned more</a> about the July 25 call President Trump had with Ukrainian president Zelensky and the fallout from it, as well as gained additional understanding about the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/20/laura-cooper-david-hale-impeachment-hearings-live-highlights-and-updates-072240">hold placed on military aid for Ukraine by the White House</a>. But the centerpiece of the week was the testimony of US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland, who didn't mince words yesterday when he asked, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/20/us/politics/gordon-sondland-opening-statement-ukraine.html">"Was there a 'quid pro quo'? And answered, "The answer is yes."</a> Which brings us to today.
  todays: 
  - item: Two weeks of public impeachment hearings wrapped today with <b>the testimony of Fiona Hill, former senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council, and David Holmes, a State Department official who works at the US Embassy in Ukraine</b>. After yesterday's lengthy, surprising testimony by US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland, I'll admit that I thought today was going to be a snooze. But it turned out to be some of the most compelling, clear, and crucial testimony of the last two weeks—every copyeditor just cringed at my use of three c's there. <i>Sorry not sorry.</i> A few highlights&#58; 
    source: 
    url:
  - item: The hearing opened with Fiona Hill taking apart the Republican theory—voiced over and over at these hearings—that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election. <b>"Some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country—and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did," she testified. "This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves."</b> Later, Hill expanded on the Russian's motivation&#58; "The goal of the Russians was really to put whoever was going to become the president … under a cloud." Whoever won, Hill explained, the Russians ultimately wanted to "pit one side of the electorate against the other. That they would pit one party against the other … That they would create just the kind of chaos that we have seen in our politics." <i>Sound familiar?</i>

  - item: David Holmes' testimony offered a first-hand account of the activity at the US embassy in Ukraine during the timeframe leading up to Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian president Zelensky, and the aftermath of that call. At the Embassy, Holmes testified, "we'd been hearing about the investigations"—into the Bidens and the 2016 election, pushed by Rudy Giulani—"since March." Giuliani's involvement, Holmes said, wasn't welcome by Ambassador Sondland, who told him "every time Rudy gets involved he goes and F's it all up." <b>But, according to Holmes, Sondland became a key conduit between Ukraine and the president on these investigations, leading to a phone call Sondland held with President Trump on the terrace of a restaurant in Kiev on July 26</b>, the day after the president's call with Ukrainian president Zelensky. Holmes, who reenacted the call with flair, said that when asked by the president if Zelensky would do "the investigations," Sondland replied "He will do it. He'll do anything you ask him to." On Twitter, the president questioned whether it was possible to overhear conversations on the phone, which, <i>screams</i>.

  - item: Sondland was a focus for Republican counsel Steve Castor who, it seemed, hoped to get Hill to cast Sondland's testimony yesterday into question. Instead, when Castor asked her what made her angry in a meeting she had with Sondland, she turned it around in stunning fashion&#58; "What I was angry about was that he wasn't coordinating with us. But I've actually realized, having listened to his deposition, that he was absolutely right. He wasn't coordinating with us because we weren't doing the same thing he was doing." So what <i>was</i> Sondland doing? "He said to me, I'm briefing the president, I'm briefing Chief of Staff Mulvaney, I'm briefing Secretary Pompeo, and I've talked with Ambassador Bolton. Who else do I have to deal with?" <b>It struck her, Hill said, as she looked at the emails Sondland supplied in yesterday's testimony, "that he was absolutely right. Because he was being involved in a domestic political errand and we were involved in national security foreign policy and those two things had just diverged.</b>" And <i>that</i>—more than almost anything else that's been said the last two weeks—is the whole problem.

  - item: While testimony continued at the House, <b>President Trump and Senate Republicans met at the White House to discuss strategy for what will likely become an impeachment trial in the Senate</b>. According to Politico, there's a feeling that "a motion to dismiss won't fly," and so instead Republicans, at the White House's prompting, "want some kind of factual affirmative defense on the merits." What kind of "merits" you ask? According to White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley, Trump "wants to be able to bring up witnesses like Adam Schiff, like the whistleblower, like Hunter Biden, like Joe Biden." <i>Disintegrates into a pile of ash; is blown away by a stiff fall breeze</i>.

Today's hearings wrapped without clear next steps given. <b>Congress takes a recess for Thanksgiving next week and, with no more hearings currently scheduled, what happens from here is a bit up in the air.</b> While I'd expect House Democrats to clarify what they're planning before going on break—and I'd be a little surprised if, coming out of Sondland's testimony yesterday, they don't attempt to call more witnesses—Bloomberg offers a useful look at the many options they have in front of them.
    source: Bloomberg

  tomorrow: Well, as I just said above, what's next is a little bit unknown. So probably what's coming next is clarity on that. And a lot of spin, maneuvering, and attempts at reframing narratives from Republicans and the White House. Oh, and Thanksgiving, which should offer a nation-wide opportunity for extremely awkward table conversations.

  yesterday: The open hearings in the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump hit hyperdrive this week with nine witnesses <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/11/13/20961074/impeachment-hearings-testimony-live-stream-taylor-kent">scheduled to testify</a>. Yesterday saw four of them testify in pairs over <i>eleven</i> hours—it was very, very long, but important, testimony from three people who were present on the president's call with Ukrainian president Zelensky on July 25. The verdict? Even among the witnesses <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/19/778657017/impeachment-hearings-resume-with-white-house-state-department-witnesses">chosen by Republicans</a>, it was "unusual" at best. All four witnesses also <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/impeachment-hearing-11-19-19/h_f30913e2622eb1fb31345ce33047f1fa">heavily implicated Rudy Giuliani and US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland</a> as lynchpins in all of this, which set up huge expectations for Sondland's testimony today. 
  todays: 
  - item: Another marathon day of testimony in the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump got off to a surprising start today when <b>US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland opened his testimony asking rhetorically "Was there a 'quid pro quo?'" and then answering, "the answer is yes."</b> <i>For real, y'all—this happened.</i> Sondland, who had been implicated as a central figure in the Ukraine controversy by almost every witness up to now, did not mince words. He testified that he aggressively pursued Ukraine's commitment to investigating the president's political rivals, in direct coordination with Rudy Giuliani, "at the express direction" of President Trump. It was remarkable. Read the whole opening statement. It is long but worth it.

  - item: <b>Sondland's testimony didn't just stop at the quid-pro-quo, but instead implicated an astounding number of people. "Everyone was in the loop. It was no secret,"</b> he explained. The people involved were so senior that Sondland pushed back on the idea that they represented an "irregular channel" of communication with Ukraine, which is how acting US ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor had described them in his testimony. "I'm not sure how someone could characterize something as an 'irregular' channel when you're talking to the President of the United States, the Secretary of State, the National Security Advisor, the Chief of Staff of the White House," he testified. "I don't know how they could consider us to be the 'irregular' channel and they to be the 'regular' channel when it's the leadership that makes decisions." <i>Well then.</i>

  - item: While Sondland repeatedly cited conversations <i>at all levels</i> tying an announcement of Ukrainian investigations into the Bidens and the 2016 election with a visit to the White House for the Ukrainian president, the connection of military aid for Ukraine never got as explicit a tie. "The aid was my own personal guess," he testified, based on "two plus two equals four." <b>Democrats pushed heavily to try and tie aid into the mix and, in the process, gave Republicans their only breathing room for the entire morning.</b> Sondland testified that he asked the president "what do you want" from Ukraine and that the president told him "I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing." 
    source: BBC
    url: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50493440

Of course they did. <b>President Trump, on his way to visit an Apple manufacturing facility in Austin Texas, was photographed holding hand-written notes that in huge Sharpied lettering read "I WANT NOTHING. I WANT NOTHING. I WANT NO QUID PRO QUO. TELL ZELENSKY TO DO THE RIGHT THING. THIS IS THE FINAL WORD FROM THE PRES OF THE U."</b> In addition to the President's Sharpie, Vice President Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and even Rudy Giuliani, pushed back on Sondland's testimony connecting all of them in the Ukrainian scheme.

  - item: The withheld Ukrainian aid was the focus of the <i>second</i> hearing of the day, which didn't get underway until nearly 6:00pm Eastern. At that hearing—which was kept mercifully short after Sondland's testimony stretched to seven hours—Laura Cooper, deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia and David Hale, under secretary of state for political affairs at the State Department, testified that neither of them—nor anyone they talked to at their respective departments—could explain why the $400 million of aid to Ukraine was on hold. Most interesting was that <b>Cooper set a new timeline for when the Ukrainians knew that the aid was put on hold</b>, which up until her testimony tonight was largely believed to be in late August. However, according to Cooper, her staff was fielding queries from Ukraine about the aid in July, including two emails on July 25, the same day President Trump had his call with Ukrainian president Zelensky. So, that's certainly something.

  - item: Think this never-ending week of testimony is over yet? <i>Not so fast!</i> Tomorrow, theoretically, brings open hearings to a close until (maybe) after Thanksgiving. <b>Things wrap tomorrow with another twofer testimony day&#58; Fiona Hill, former senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council, and David Holmes, a State Department official who works at the US Embassy in Ukraine.</b> At her closed-door deposition, Hill testified of a tenure at the NSC "filled with hateful calls, conspiracy theories," and at his, Holmes gave a detailed report of an overhead conversation between Sondland and President Trump, so tomorrow should be fairly wild. It may also be the final day of public testimony in this phase of the impeachment inquiry, but I wouldn't put any bets on that.

  tomorrow: If tomorrow's testimony really is the last in this phase of the impeachment inquiry—things would move to the Judiciary Committee after this—then expect plenty of fireworks. But, there are lots of people that have been implicated in this week's testimony and a few legal questions actively making their way through courts that may offer opportunities to compel their testimony, I wouldn't be surprised if things go past this week, which should make for wild Thanksgiving conversations.

  yesterday: Tuesday was so long, remembering back to the days before feels like looking through the mists of time. There was a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Unclassified09.2019.pdf">phone call</a>?

  todays: 
  - item: Tuesday's double-stacked impeachment inquiry—two witnesses in the morning, two in the afternoon—felt like a day that would never end. But, finally, <i>after over 11 hours of televised testimony</i>, it did. <i>Bursts into tears</i>. What did we learn after all this testimony? Largely that depended on where you fell on the ideological spectrum—which definitely applies to all these hearings, but was especially pronounced today as the two witnesses in the afternoon were specifically requested by Republicans, while the morning picks were by Democrats. That meant that <b>while a lot of the testimony overlapped—three of the four witnesses today were present for the July 25 call between President Trump and Ukrainian president Zelensky—there was divergence in the details, or at least in how they were interpreted.</b> Also, have I mentioned that it was a long day? <i>It was a very long day.</i> Let's break this down person by person&#58;
    source: 
    url:
  - item: In the morning, <b>Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, who wore his Army dress uniform, testified that he "couldn’t believe what I was hearing" when he listened in to the July 25 call between President Trump and Ukrainian president Zelensky.</b> "It was probably an element of shock—that maybe, in certain regards, my worst fear of how our Ukraine policy could play out was playing out, and how this was likely to have significant implications for US national security," he said. Vindman withstood attacks by Republicans, who attempted to question his loyalty to the country, and a tweet from the official White House account during his testimony that questioned his judgement. Why go through all this? "This is America," he explained. "This is the country I've served and defended—that all of my brothers have served—and here, right matters." Let's hope.

  - item: Also testifying in the morning was Jennifer Williams, national security aide to Vice President Pence. <b>Williams, who was also present for the July 25 call, described the call as "unusual" and said that it "involved discussion of what appeared to be a domestic political matter."</b> In the dozen or so calls between heads of state she'd been involved with before, she said, she'd never heard something like that brought up. Specifically, Williams testified, the reference to former VP Joe Biden "struck me as political in nature given that the former vice president is a political opponent of the president." I mean, yeah, that sounds right.

  - item: In his afternoon testimony, US special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker said that while he originally didn't think there was anything unusual in regards to his work with Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, and US ambassador to the EU Gordan Sondland—both of whom were working backchannels to Ukraine for the president—in retrospect he should have picked up on all the clues they were laying down. <i>Really</i>. <b>"In hindsight," Volker testified, "I now understand that others saw the idea of investigating possible corruption involving the Ukrainian company, Burisma, as equivalent to investigating former Vice President Biden. I saw them as very different. The former being appropriate and unremarkable, the latter being unacceptable."</b> Sure, OK man. "In retrospect"—which really could have been Volker's catchphrase for the day—"I should have seen that connection differently, and had I done so, I would have raised my own objections." Keep in mind, this was a guy Republicans <i>wanted</i> to testify.

Immediately following the call—on which he testified he was "not concerned that anything illegal was discussed"—he recommended to NSC lawyers that the call be classified because its contents could leak. Which, <i>thinking guy emoji</i>. While he may not have heard anything illegal on the call he immediately recommended be classified—<i>stares</i>—he didn't hear a lot he liked either. <b>Morrison testified that while he prepared a lot of anti-corruption talking points for the president, Trump disregarded them and that the topics he <i>did</i> bring up—namely the Bidens and the DNC server—were "not what we recommended the President discuss."</b> Ya think?

  yesterday: In last week's open impeachment hearings, we heard from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/politics/marie-yovanovitch-testimony.html">former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/13/trump-impeachment-hearings-070089">acting ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor, and State Department Ukraine expert George Kent</a>. The three officials, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/13/public-impeachment-hearings-live-highlights-and-updates-070279">who testified over two days</a>, told the House Intelligence Committee about <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/5-takeaways-public-testimony-n1081661">"side channels" of communication</a>—<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-attacks-ambassador-even-as-she-describes-feeling-threatened-by-him/2019/11/15/c14eefaa-07bc-11ea-8ac0-0810ed197c7e_story.html">run by Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, and Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU</a>—between the US and Ukraine that worked to undermine the work of officials like Yovanovich—<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/5-things-we-learned-marie-yovanovitch-s-impeachment-testimony-n1083341">who was fired this spring</a>—and were used to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/impeachment-public-hearings-live-stream-testimony-from-bill-taylor-george-kent-today-2019-11-13/">pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate the president's political rivals in return for military aid that was being withheld</a>. There was a lot. This week promises much, much more. Hang on. 
  todays: 
  - item: If you were hoping Monday was going to start out easy, President Trump took to Twitter early this morning to put an end to that. <b>In a multi-tweet diatribe, Trump wrote that while he "did nothing wrong," he'd "strongly consider" giving written testimony to House impeachment investigators.</b> <i>Stares</i> Of course, he did it while insulting Nancy Pelosi, the House Democrats, the impeachment inquiry, and the news show Face the Nation, so, well, maybe it wasn't the most sincere offer ever? Anyway, he ended his Twitter thread by saying "I like the idea & will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it." Let's just assume that's <i>definitely</i> going to happen.

  - item: Of course, even as the president said he'd consider providing written testimony to Congress, <b>the House was in court arguing that he may have lied in his written testimony provided to the Mueller investigation</b>. "There is evidence, very sadly, that the President might have provided untruthful answers and this is a key part of the impeachment inquiry," House general counsel Douglas Letter told the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit today. The House is in court to force the Department of Justice to turn over grand jury material from the Mueller investigation. On top of the questions the House is already attempting to answer by gaining access to these documents, Friday's conviction of Trump associate Roger Stone has opened questions as to whether Trump's written answers to Mueller in regards to what he knew about Stone's contacts with Wikileaks were untrue. So it's definitely a good idea to have him provide written testimony again, that's for sure.

  - item:  Meanwhile, fallout from last week's open impeachment hearings has reached the "palace intrigue" stage. NBC News reported today that <b>the "impeachment inquiry has created the first rift between President Donald Trump and the Cabinet member who has been his closest ally, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo."</b> Most of the testimony in the House impeachment inquiry—both closed-door and open—has come from current and former State Department officials. According to NBC, "Pompeo 'feels like he's getting a bunch of blame from the president and the White House for having hired all these people who are turning against Trump and that it's the State Department that is going to bring him down, so it's all Pompeo's fault.'" Well then.

  - item: So probably it's not great for Pompeo that yet another <i>another</i> State Department staffer is now scheduled to testify in open hearings. <b>David Holmes, who works at the US Embassy in Ukraine, has been added to the public testimony schedule for Thursday.</b> Holmes overheard the July 26 phone call that US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland had with Trump in a crowded restaurant and <i>just</i> testified behind closed doors on Friday. During that call, Holmes testified that he heard the president ask Sondland if Ukrainian president Zelensky was "gonna do the investigation" into the Bidens, to which Sondland responded that Zelensky would do "anything you ask him to." Holmes will now testify alongside White House National Security Council official Fiona Hill on Thursday, making him the <i>ninth</i> witness scheduled to testify this week. Nine. <i>Cries</i>.

  yesterday: The first week of open hearings in the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump saw the testimony of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/politics/marie-yovanovitch-testimony.html">former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/13/trump-impeachment-hearings-070089">acting ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor, and State Department Ukraine expert George Kent</a>. Across the two days of testimony we learned much more about the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/transcript-of-envoy-bill-taylors-testimony-to-be-released-11573061931">hold placed on military aide for Ukraine and the demands for investigations into the president's political rivals</a> to ensure its release. Additionally, we learned more about the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/live-blog/trump-impeachment-inquiry-live-updates-latest-news-n1065706/ncrd1081691">"smear campaign"</a> waged against Yovanovich that <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/yovanovitch-says-she-was-told-to-return-to-the-u-s-on-the-next-plane">eventually lead to her firing</a>. It was a very full week that only continues to get fuller.  
  todays: 
  - item: The House Intelligence committee was back behind closed doors on Saturday to hear the testimony of Mark Sandy, deputy associate director for national security programs at the Office of Management and Budget. The Office of Management and Budget has been a missing link in testimony up to now, with the acting director and other officials defying Congressional subpoenas. The budget office is the administration arm that actually placed the hold on $400M of Ukrainian military aid that sits at the center of the impeachment inquiry. According to the Wall Street Journal, <b>Sandy told investigators that the hold was "unusual" and that he was never told why the money needed to be held back.</b> Regardless, Sandy signed off on the hold on July 25, the same day as President Trump's call wtih Ukrainian president Zelensky.

  - item: Saturday also saw the release of two transcripts from last month's closed-door depositions&#58; Tim Morrison, a Russia expert on the National Security Counsel, and Jennifer Williams, a national security aide to VP Pence. <b>Morrison, who was listening in on the president's July 25 call with Ukrainian president Zelensky, testified that even though he didn't think the president did anything illegal on the call—though the mention of investigations "seemed unusual"—he told NSC lawyers they should restrict access to the call transcript because the contents might leak.</b> <i>Sure, why not.</i> Morison also testified that he was concerned about alternative channels in US/Ukraine communications led by US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland. "At some point I became concerned that this parallel process was going to turn into something—and here we are." Here we are indeed.

  - item: If "unusual" seems like the word of the day in this update, <i>that's because it is!</i> In the other transcript released yesterday, <b>Vice President Pence's national security aide Jennifer Williams, described Trump's request to investigate political opponents "unusual and inappropriate"</b> and that she viewed Trump's requests to be "more specific to the president in nature, to his personal political agenda, as opposed to a broader … foreign policy objective of the United States." Additionally, Williams testified that Ukrainian energy company Burisma was mentioned on the July 25th call, but there's no mention of Burisma in the summary transcript of the call released by the White House which, <i>thinking face emoji</i>.

  - item: Speaking of discrepancies in White House call transcripts, <b>the Friday release of a rough transcript of an earlier call between Trump and Zelensky raised some questions because it diverged significantly from the original summary of the call back in April</b>. The original summary said the two talked about working together to "root out corruption," which doesn't appear in the new transcript at all. The reason? Apparently the summary was written in advance of the call and, "because the call occurred on a Sunday, likely wasn’t updated." I got nothing.

  - item: Finally, and <i>heavily</i> in "I got nothing" territory, CNN reported late Friday night on a meeting last year between president Trump, Rudy Giuliani, and the two Giuliani associates who are now under arrest for campaign finance violations, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. After the meeting, which took place during the White House Hanukkah party, <b>Parnas told people he was on "a secret mission" from the president to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate the Bidens</b>. <i>This happened during the White House Hanukkah party</i>, I can not stress that enough. Parnas "told everyone in Ukraine about the White House meeting," Ken McCallion, a former federal prosecutor with numerous high-level clients in Ukraine told CNN. "He was adamant he was 'their guy'—that they chose him to be their ambassador in Ukraine." Meanwhile <i>in actual reality</i>, Parnas was one of the people, along with Fruman and Giuliani, cited by former US ambassador Marie Yovanovitch as involved in the "smear campaign" that lead to her ouster as ambassador.

  tomorrow: Open testimony in the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump resumes on Tuesday with <i>eight</i> witnesses scheduled for this week. That's more than twice as many as this past week if you need a good sense of just how bananas things are going to get.

  yesterday: Welcome to the end of the first full week of open impeachment hearings! Wednesday saw <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/13/trump-impeachment-hearings-070089">testimony by acting ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor and George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs</a> that outlined the contours of the case the Democrats are making against the president. That brings us to today, which had more public testimony and then literally everything else too. There is a lot. <i>Lololol.</i>
  todays: 
  - item: The second public hearing in the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump took place in the House of Representatives today. <b>The House Intelligence Committee questioned former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch for hours about the circumstances surrounding her abrupt firing from her post this spring</b>. Over the course of her testimony, Yovanovitch outlined the smear campaign against her run by Rudy Giuliani and ousted former Ukrainian prosecutors. "When our anti-corruption efforts got in the way of a desire for profit or power, Ukrainians who preferred to play by the old, corrupt rules sought to remove me," she testified. "What continues to amaze me is that they found Americans willing to partner with them and, working together, they apparently succeeded in orchestrating the removal of a US Ambassador." In her testimony, she asked a very simple question that is endemic to this whole mess&#58; "How could our system fail like this?"

  - item: Unbelievably, <b>while Yovanovitch was testifying about feeling attacked by President Trump during his July 25 call with Ukrainian president Zelensky, Trump took to Twitter to, well, attack her again.</b> <i>For real</i>. "Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad," he tweeted. "She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him." <i>I just. I can't.</i> A few minutes later, House Intelligence chair Adam Schiff interrupted the Democratic lawyer's questioning to read the tweet to ambassador Yovanovitch, who visibly slumped in her chair on hearing it, saying "It’s very intimidating." Schiff responded&#58; "Some of us here take witness intimidation very, very seriously." <i>I genuinely can't believe that happened</i>, yet here we are.

  - item: Finally—<i>finally</i>—the day began with what seemed like an attempt to get a leg up on the news cycle when <b>the White House released a rough transcript of another call Trump had with Ukrainian president Zelensky</b>. This call, held days after Zelensky's election in April, involved little more than congratulations between the men. That should have been that, except that the transcript they released "bared little resemblance" to the summary of the call the White House originally released back in April, the Associated Press found. Specificaly, that original summary said that the two discussed ways to help Ukraine "implement reforms that strengthen democracy, increase prosperity, and root out corruption," but there was no discussion of corruption on the call. So like, <i>huh?</i> Also missing from the original summary was a discussion about Ukrainian beauty pageant contestants. "When I owned Miss Universe, they always had great people," Trump said to Zelensky, according to the new transcript. <i>Falls to ground. Shatters into dust.</i>

  todays: 
  - item: The big revelation from yesterday's impeachment hearing, that US ambassador to Ukraine Gordon Sondland was overheard having a phone conversation with President Trump in Kyiv the day after Trump's July call with Ukrainian president Zelensky, was backed up by a second witness today. Because of course it was. <b>According to the Associated Press, a second diplomatic staffer at the same restaurant overheard the conversation between Sondland and Trump as well.</b> On the call, which William Taylor testified about yesterday, Trump was overheard <i>yelling through the phone</i> about "investigations" into the Bidens. When asked about the call today, Trump told reporters that he didn't remember making that call "not even a little bit." Well OK then.

  - item: Repercussions from yesterday's testimony found their way to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's weekly press conference today. <b>Pelosi told reporters that the testimony "corroborated evidence of bribery uncovered in the inquiry."</b> Which, I mean, that's been clear for a while right? The key part of the statement was Pelosi's use of the word "bribery" which is specifically used in the Constitution as an impeachable offense&#58; "treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors." Since "high crimes and misdemeanors" is open to interpretation, the belief is that "bribery" is the incantation that gives far less wiggle room. Maybe smash a horcrux or two to be safe.

Senator Kevin Cramer told the Wall Street Journal. "And he just shuffled it across the table and I read it and gave it back." It's worth noting that the Republican Senators he shared the transcript with will be jurors on his impeachment trial if it reaches the Senate so like, <i>lol nothing matters</i>. Anyway, in a Tweet this Monday, Trump said he'd release the "transcript of the first, and therefore more important, phone call with the Ukrainian President before week’s end." So we've got <i>that</i> to look forward to even if we're not Republican Senators maybe I guess.

  - item: Finally, <b>the open impeachment hearings continue <i>tomorrow</i> with the testimony of former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch</b>. Yovanovitch was the recipient of a lengthy smear campaign masterminded by Rudy Giuliani that lead to her ouster as ambassador earlier this year.

Yovanovitch's testimony will begin at 10am Eastern tomorrow and follow the same format as Wednesday's&#58; Opening statements, followed by 90 minutes of questioning by Democratic and Republican lawyers (45 minutes per), followed by 5 minute rounds of a jacketless Representative Jim Jordan yelling—<i>er</i>, I mean 5 minute rounds of Committee member questions, alternating between Republican and Democrat.

  yesterday: I could give a long, history-filled preamble of what has lead us to today, as I've done every day this week. But let's face it&#58; Wednesday, November 13 was the first day of the public impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump and let's just get straight to that shall we?
  todays: 
  - item: <b>For only the third time in modern presidential history, the House of Representatives today started hearings that could result in the impeachment of a sitting president.</b> The questioning of William Taylor, acting US ambassador to the Ukraine, and George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, lasted from 10am until 2:30pm Eastern with only short breaks throughout. The hearing was a mix of courtroom—the first 90 minutes of questioning was largely done by lawyers representing Republicans and Democrats—and clownshow—every Rep still got five minutes to either ask questions or showboat in the last two hours—and testimony largely covered ground that Taylor and Kent had previously covered in their closed-door testimony last month. But public testimony is very different than reading transcripts and it was historic however you cut it. This phase of the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump has officially begun.

  - item: The biggest revelation of the day's testimony came early when <b>Ambassador Taylor described an previously-unknown phone call between President Trump and US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland</b>—a central figure in the US/Ukraine narrative that sits at the center of the impeachment proceedings. The phone call took place on July 26, the day after the now-infamous call between Trump and Ukrainian president Zelensky, and was overheard by one of Taylor's staffers. On the call, Trump—who was speaking loud enough that Taylor's staffer could hear him through the phone—asked Sondland about "the investigations" which Sondland then responded were "ready to move forward." After the call, Taylor's staffer asked Sondland what Trump thought about Ukraine. “Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for," Taylor testified. That quote, that the President cared more about investigating Biden than he cared about Ukraine, came up in questioning repeatedly after Taylor dropped it.

  - item: Taylor, a career diplomat who speaks in a deep Leonard-Nimoy-esque bass, repeatedly centered his testimony around Ukraine and its importance in the global order. <b>In his opening statement, he labored to remind Congressmembers and the public that "there are two Ukraine stories today."</b> The first "is the one we are discussing this morning and that you have been hearing for the past two weeks. It is a rancorous story about whistleblowers, Mr Giuliani, side channels, quid pro quos, corruption, and interference in elections. In this story, Ukraine is merely an object." He continued&#58; "But there is another Ukraine story—a positive, bipartisan one. In this second story, Ukraine is the subject. This one is about young people in a young nation struggling to break free of its past." It was a human moment in a hearing that was largely absent of them.

  - item: For his part George Kent—dressed like the natty professor in a tweed suit and bow tie—spent a good deal of his testimony defending other diplomats who he felt were the recipients of a Rudy Giuliani-led "campaign to smear." <b>Along with Giuliani and his associates, Kent testified that the "chief agitators" on the Ukrainian side were prosecutors fired for corruption who were "now peddling false information in order to exact revenge against those who had exposed their misconduct."</b> Sound like great guys all around.

Those topics? "Democrats prior coordination with the whistleblower. … Second, the full extent of the Ukraine's meddling against the Trump campaign. … And third why did Burisma hire Hunter Biden and what did he do for them." <i>Screams into the void forever.</i>

  yesterday: This is it. 50 days ago, on September 24, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/democrats-impeachment-trump.html">Nancy Pelosi announced that an impeachment inquiry was underway</a> after a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/read-the-whistleblower-complaint-regarding-president-trump-s-communications-with-ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelensky/4b9e0ca5-3824-467f-b1a3-77f2d4ee16aa/">whistleblower alerted Congress</a> to a potential quid-pro-quo <a href="https://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=6429015-Trump-Ukraine-Transcript">in a call</a> between President Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. After investigating for a little more than a month behind closed doors, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/house-to-vote-on-rules-governing-next-phase-of-trump-impeachment-inquiry/2019/10/31/bc2f5e7a-fbcc-11e9-ac8c-8eced29ca6ef_story.html">the full House voted</a> on Halloween to officially authorize the impeachment inquiry. In the two weeks since that vote, House investigative committees have wrapped their closed-door depositions and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/11/8/20954212/impeachment-transcripts-sondland-taylor-today-explained">released extensive transcripts</a> from that testimony. And now, tomorrow, the open inquiry begins. Let's do this.
  todays: 
  - item: <b>Public hearings in the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump begin tomorrow.</b> Damn right that's going to lead today's update. Tomorrow will see dual testimony from William Taylor, acting US ambassador to the Ukraine, and George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs. Yes, they're testifying at the same time. No, I don't know why. The full schedule for tomorrow&#58;<ul><li>The hearing will begin at 10am Eastern.</li><li>From there, Democrat Adam Schiff, House Intelligence Committee chair, and Republican Devin Nunes, ranking member, will make opening statements followed by opening statements from Taylor and Kent.</li><li>Following opening statements, both Schiff and Nunes, and designated committee lawyers, will get 45 minutes each to question witnesses.</li><li>After that, each member of the committee will get five minutes each to ask questions, swapping between Democrat and Republican. There are 22 members of the committee, so that's—<i>does math</i>—110 minutes.</li><li>As of now, it's expected that things will wrap up between 2&#58;30 and 4&#58;30 Eastern.</li> </ul>
  - item: To kick things off for tomorrow, <b>House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff wrote a letter to House members today</b>. The letter—which much of the above timeline comes from—gives both rules and context for impeachment hearings, restates the parameters of the questioning tomorrow, which is supposed to be tightly focused on the president's conduct in regards to Ukraine, and underscores that the inquiry "will not serve as venues for any Member to further the same sham investigations into the Bidens or into debunked conspiracies about 2016 US election interference that President Trump pressed Ukraine to undertake for his personal political benefit." We'll see how <i>that</i> goes. "Above all," Schiff wrote, "these hearings are intended to bring the facts to light for the American people." Here we go.

  - item: Meanwhile today wasn't <i>just</i> about setting things up for tomorrow. <b>We learned more about the timeline of the withheld Ukrainian aid from the transcript of Laura Cooper, deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia.</b> The New York Times reports that Cooper "testified that she and other Pentagon officials had warned the White House over the summer that continuing to deny Ukraine security assistance that had been approved by Congress could eventually cause the administration to run afoul of the law."

  tomorrow: This is it&#58; Open impeachment proceedings begin tomorrow with the testimony of William Taylor and George Kent, followed by a second hearing on Friday with former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. This is only the third time in modern presidential history that this has happened. It's go time, let's see some hustle, and all that stuff. 
- date: 2019-11-11
  yesterday: All the final preparations for this week's start of public impeachment hearings are in motion. In addition to the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/11/8/20954212/impeachment-transcripts-sondland-taylor-today-explained">release of a steady stream of transcripts</a> from the last month of closed-door depositions, over the weekend, House Republicans sent a <a href="https://republicans-intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/rm_letter_to_chm_re_witness_request.pdf">very ambitious list</a> of witnesses they'd like to call (spoiler alert&#58; they won't get many of them). And with that, we've suddenly reached <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/11/politics/house-impeachment-schedule-guide/index.html">open impeachment inquiry week</a>. Here we go.
  todays: 
  - item: Monday was the quietest day we'll have all week, with both a federal holiday today and the (relative) calm before the storm of public impeachment hearings starts on Wednesday. Today did bring the official schedule for those public hearings, with House Intelligence chair <b>Adam Schiff's office announcing that things will kick off at 10am Wednesday with the dual testimony of William Taylor, acting US ambassador to the Ukraine, and George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs</b>. Taylor's closed-door testimony included a detailed outline of the "irregular channels" of communication with Ukraine run by Rudy Giuliani. Kent's previous testimony attested to a "campaign of lies" that lead to the firing of former Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who testifies in the open on Friday. This is really happening—set your DVRs.

  - item: Despite the federal holiday, transcripts from the last month of closed-door depositions continued to be released. <b>Today saw the release of transcripts of testimony from Laura Cooper—deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia—and Catherine Croft and Christopher Anderson, two State Department Ukraine specialists</b>. The transcripts continue to flesh out an understanding of both the hold placed on aid to Ukraine that sits at the center of the impeachment inquiry as well as the involvement of the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, in Ukrainian affairs. In his testimony Anderson said that National Security Advisor John Bolton "made a joke about every time Ukraine is mentioned, Giuliani pops up." So basically, Giuliani is like the Candyman, only <i>terrible</i>.

  - item: While the final lineup of people called to testify in this phase of the impeachment inquiry is still being settled, one person we officially won't hear from is the whistleblower who kicked everything off with their report to Congress in September. Republicans—and the president himself (more on that in a sec)—have wanted to call the whistleblower, but in responding to their request, <b>Adam Schiff said that the Intelligence Committee "will not facilitate efforts by President Trump and his allies in Congress to threaten, intimidate, and retaliate against the whistleblower"</b> and that the whistleblower has a right to remain anonymous. That's going to go over great I am sure. 
    source: CNN

  - item: Even though hearings begin in two days, the Republican strategy for the impeachment continues to evolve, with <b>Representative Jim Jordan temporarily assigned to the House Intelligence Committee so he can sit in on the open hearings</b>. Jordan was one of the Republicans that lead the occupation of the secure room where depositions were being held last month as a way of protesting the closed-door nature of the hearings—despite the fact that he had full access to the hearings as the head Republican on the House Oversight Committee. "You want your best contributors for 'showtime,'" one Republican told Politico. "Jordan is definitely a showman." <i>Stares</i>.

  - item: Finally, <b>the president spent much of the day tweeting about the impeachment proceedings</b>, including saying that "the Whistleblower, his lawyer, and Corrupt politician Schiff should be investigated for fraud!" He paused his tweeting to take part in New York's Veterans Day Parade. When he started again a few hours later, he accused Adam Schiff of having "fabricated my phone call, he will fabricate the transcripts that he is making and releasing!" I'm sure the rest of the week is going to go great.

  tomorrow: Over the weekend President Trump claimed that on Tuesday he would release a summary transcript of another call he had with Ukrainian president Zelensky. Maybe that will happen? If not, expect more transcripts from testimony to be released by Democrats, more accusations from Republicans about the proceedings not being fair, and more planning by Democrats for those proceedings to proceed anyway. We're just two days away now.
- date: 2019-11-10
  yesterday: After the announcement of an impeachment inquiry in the House on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/democrats-impeachment-trump.html">September 24</a>, the month of closed-door testimony that followed, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/house-to-vote-on-rules-governing-next-phase-of-trump-impeachment-inquiry/2019/10/31/bc2f5e7a-fbcc-11e9-ac8c-8eced29ca6ef_story.html">vote to move the inquiry to a new, more public, phase</a> on October 31, and last week's <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/11/8/20954212/impeachment-transcripts-sondland-taylor-today-explained">release of transcripts</a> from testimony, we are now just a few days away from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/house-to-hold-first-open-hearings-in-impeachment-inquiry-of-trump/2019/11/06/90041c3c-00bd-11ea-9518-1e76abc088b6_story.html">open impeachment hearings</a>, which begin on Wednesday. If you thought things moved fast before, well hang on. 
  todays: 
  - item: <b>Republican House members had a deadline of Saturday to produce their wish list of witnesses for the next phase of the impeachment inquiry</b>. How's it looking? Well, it's "a list that includes former vice president Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden"—<i>stares</i>—"and the anonymous whistleblower who filed the initial complaint against President Trump. What's the strategy here? "Republicans want to publicly question witnesses who would divert the conversation away from questions about Trump’s behavior to allegations only tangentially related to the case," writes the Washington Post. <i>Checks out</i>. However, Democrats have final say on who actually gets called, so expect "failure to fulfill Minority witness requests shall constitute evidence of your denial of fundamental fairness and due process" to become a talking point when half these folks aren't called. <i>I need a nap</i>.

  - item: From putting "impeachment inquiry" in quotes every time he uses it, to the list of witnesses that reads like a greatest-hits collection of three years of conspiracy theories—including a DNC staffer who "can assist Congress and the American public in better understanding the facts and circumstances surrounding Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election"—<b>the entirety of Devin Nunes's letter is worth a read</b>. This is an actual document in an actual inquiry in actual Congress. <i>Lights self on fire</i>.

  - item: The GOP list wasn't the only Republican maneuvering happening this weekend. Late Friday night, <b>acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney asked to join the lawsuit requesting a judicial decision on whether White House staff should comply with House subpoenas or White House directives of non-compliance</b>. Does this mean that the chief of staff of the White House is attempting to sue the White House? Yes, yes it does. The lawsuit, originally filed by National Security Counsel deputy Charles Kupperman, is also holding up the testimony of National Security Advisor John Bolton. The first hearing is scheduled for December 10. <i>Checks calendar. Bursts into tears</i>.

  - item: Speaking of John Bolton, <b>a puzzling report from Bloomberg on Saturday placed Bolton at the center of the release of the withheld funds to Ukraine</b>. "Shortly before September 9, Bolton had relayed a message to the State Department that the funding could go ahead. It’s not clear whether Bolton, who resigned from the job a week later, did so with Trump’s approval," Bloomberg reports. <i>Wait what?</i> This report directly contradicts the White House's narrative that Trump himself lifted the hold on the money on September 11 after a phone call with Republican Senator Rob Portman. "I gave the money because Rob Portman and others called me and asked," Trump told reporters last month. The hold and later release of Ukrainian aid—and who knew what when—is a key element of the impeachment inquiry. My head genuinely hurts.

  - item: If that isn't enough for one weekend, <b>President Trump told reporters yesterday that the White House was readying the release of a second transcript summary with Ukrainian president Zelensky</b>. "We have another transcript coming out which is very important," he told reporters before going to a football game Saturday. He said that the summary, from a call in April after Zelensky won the Ukrainian election, would be released on Tuesday, a day before open impeachment hearings begin. Sure, why not.

  tomorrow: Hey, Monday is a federal holiday so nobody's really supposed to be doing any work. But it's also two days before open impeachment hearings begin, there's the potential of a new Ukrainian transcript, and a lot of back-and-forthing about witnesses to deal with so... <i>weeps for an uncomfortably long time.</i> 
- date: 2019-11-08
  yesterday: After a month of closed-door testimony and a week of <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/11/8/20954212/impeachment-transcripts-sondland-taylor-today-explained">transcripts</a> from that testimony being released, we're just a few days away from the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/house-to-hold-first-open-hearings-in-impeachment-inquiry-of-trump/2019/11/06/90041c3c-00bd-11ea-9518-1e76abc088b6_story.html">first open hearings</a> in this impeachment inquiry. This week has largely been about clearing the deck for those hearings&#58; regular release of transcripts, strategy sessions by both <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/07/house-republicans-want-whistleblower-testify-public-impeachment-hearings-067292">Democrats</a> and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/as-impeachment-inquiry-enters-public-phase-republicans-consider-moving-jim-jordan-to-house-intelligence-committee/">Republicans</a>, and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/02/politics/democrats-impeachment-next-steps/index.html">generally maneuvering</a> to prepare for the show. Here we go.
  todays: 
  - item: As the House prepares for open hearings next week, two more transcripts from last month's closed-door testimony were released. The first, by Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, the director for European affairs for the National Security Council, gave a vivid look into the July 25 call between president Trump and Ukrainian president Zelensky. "I’m struggling for the words," he told investigators, "but it was not a positive call." <b>When asked if there was any doubt in his mind that Trump was asking Zelensky to investigate his political rivals as a "deliverable," Vindman responded "There was no doubt."</b> <i>Well then.</i> Of course that wasn't enough for Republican Rep John Ratcliffe who pressed Vindman to define what he meant by a "deliverable."  Vindman explained further&#58; "it became completely apparent what the deliverable would be in order to get a White House meeting. That deliverable was reinforced by the President. … The demand was, in order to get the White House meeting, they had to deliver an investigation."

  - item: The transcript of Fiona Hill, senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council was also released today. <b>In her deposition, Hill describes a hellish tenure at the NSC "filled with hateful calls, conspiracy theories … accusing me of being a Soros mole in the White House, of colluding with all kinds of enemies of the president, and, you know, of various improprieties."</b> I've had some bad jobs, but <i>omg</i>. When she reported this to her boss, John Bolton, he told her to go to NSC lawyer John Eisenberg&#58; "You go and tell Eisenberg that I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up on this, and you go and tell him what you've heard and what I've said." Well OK then.

  - item: Speaking of Fiona Hill's boss John Bolton, the former National Security Advisor continues to be a mustachioed enigma in these proceedings, appearing as a critical voice in many transcripts but refusing to appear. <b>Today his lawyer said that John Bolton knows about "many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far."</b> Well, out with it then, right? Not so fast—his lawyer wants a judge to decide whether Bolton should abide by House subpoena or the White House directive of non-cooperation. If that sounds familiar it's because Bolton's lawyer is the same lawyer as Charles Kupperman who has already sued for the same reason. His case is being heard December 10, so it may be a while before we hear about those "relevant meetings and conversations."

  - item: While we're talking about not appearing, <b>White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney refused to comply with a subpoena today and skipped his hearing with House investigators</b>. You are <i>shocked</i>, I know. He waited until literally the last minute to do it, according to Time. "Mulvaney’s lawyer informed the committees leading the impeachment probe one minute before the deposition was supposed to start that Mulvaney had been directed not to comply with the subpoena." So there's your fun fact for the day.

  - item: <b>If you were wondering how next week's public hearings were weighing on the president, he's "not concerned about anything,"</b> he told White House reporters today. <i>Hmmmmm</i>. "The testimony has all been fine," he said (side note&#58; <i>it hasn't</i>). "I mean, for the most part, I never even heard of these people. I have no idea who they are," which is a little odd because he appointed a number of them. Anyway, he added that "They shouldn't be having public hearings; this is a hoax." <i>Screams into the void for all eternity.</i> Public hearings begin on Wednesday.

  tomorrow: Before public hearings begin next week, Republicans have a deadline of <i>tomorrow</i> to submit the list of witnesses they'd like to call in the hearings. Since Democrats have final say on who actually will be testifying, expect a lot of fireworks over the weekend. Good thing we update on Sunday mid-day. Keep an eye out. And, like, hydrate and get extra sleep or something—next week is going to be a long one. Maybe this is just advice for me. <i>Cries</i>.

That's soon.
  todays: 
  - item: Preparation for next week's start of open impeachment hearings continued today with <b>Democrats revealing the three questions they are using as the "official parameters" of  public hearings</b>&#58; <ul><li>Did the President request that a foreign leader and government initiate investigations to benefit the President's personal political interests in the United States, including an investigation related to the President's political rival and potential opponent in the 2020 US presidential election?</li><li>Did the President–directly or through agents–seek to use the power of the Office of the President and other instruments of the federal government in other ways to apply pressure on the head of state and government of Ukraine to advance the President's personal political interests, including by leveraging an Oval Office meeting desired by the President of Ukraine or by withholding US military assistance to Ukraine?</li><li>Did the President and his Administration seek to obstruct, suppress or cover up information to conceal from the Congress and the American people evidence about the President's actions and conduct?</li></ul>These tightly-focused inquiry parameters appear to be an attempt to keep the next phase of the impeachment inquiry—which will allow Republicans to call their own witnesses as well—dialed into the key question of presidential abuse of power.

  - item: As <b>Republicans draw up their list of potential witnesses they'd like to call, their number one appears to be the anonymous whistleblower who kicked off the whole impeachment inquiry</b>. How would an anonymous whistleblower testify in an open hearing? Well, according to Republican Rep Mark Meadows, "The whistleblower statute never required for anonymity." Which, <i>thinking face emoji</i>. Republicans have until Saturday to deliver their list of witnesses to Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff. But—<i>twist</i>—Democrats have veto power on anyone on their list so all bets are off on who actually makes it through.

  - item: In addition to figuring out their list of potential witnesses, Republicans are also deciding if they want to shift the makeup of their side of the Intelligence Committee, which will lead this stage of the inquiry. Specifically, <b>Republicans are considering moving Jim Jordan, currently the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, over to Intelligence</b>. Why make the move? "We are interested in putting together the best team," a senior Republican aide told CBS News. Jim Jordan is their best player? I, uh—<i>walks away slowly.</i>

The White House attempted to block Williams, but she appeared under subpoena. This is potentially a "what did the Vice President know and when did he know it" moment for the inquiry, as Williams is the first person from Pence's staff to give a deposition. While we don't yet know what she covered, her lawyer said "we expect her testimony will largely reflect what is already in the public record." After the release of thousands of pages of transcripts this week, there is <i>a lot</i> in the public record.

The vote, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/31/us/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry-house-vote.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage">which split largely along party lines</a>, outlined the next steps for the impeachment inquiry, which is investigating whether President Trump abused his power by connecting the release of military aid to Ukraine with Ukraine investigating his political rivals. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/us/politics/impeachment-resolution-trump.html">Those next steps</a> included the release of transcripts of closed-door testimony collected up to now, and the promise of a more public phase of the inquiry. 
  todays: 
  - item: The "public phase" of the impeachment inquiry got a start date today. After last week's floor vote in the House, the impeachment inquiry has looked pretty much the same, with closed-door testimony scheduled all week. But that stops next week when <b>the first public testimony in the impeachment inquiry will be held Wednesday, November 13</b>. That day will see <i>two</i> televised testimonies by William Taylor, acting US ambassador to the Ukraine, and George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs. Former US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch—who, according to testimony over the last month, was smeared repeatedly by Trump loyalists before being fired—is scheduled to testify publicly  on Friday the 15th. All three were previously deposed by House investigative committees, but now will testify in an open, televised setting. Cue the fireworks.

  - item: Between now and then, House committees will continue to release transcripts of the closed-door testimony taken over the last month. <b>Today, transcripts of the ten-hour testimony of William Taylor were released</b>. Over the lengthy transcripts, Taylor paints a picture of US Ukraine policy running through Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, instead of diplomats—as he calls it, a "regular channel" (US diplomats) and an "irregular channel" (Giuliani and various cronies). "The irregular channel seemed to focus on specific issues, specific cases, rather than the regular channel's focus on institution building," Taylor testified. Those specific issues? Take a guess. Taylor's detailed testimony gives extensive names and dates thanks in part to his extensive notetaking. As he explains, "I keep a little notebook where I take notes on conversations, in particular when I’m not in the office. So, in meetings with Ukrainian officials or when I'm out and I get a phone call and I can—I keep notes." All hail the notetakers.

  - item: The release of another transcript this week resulted in a dramatic revision. <b>Gordon Sondland, US ambassador to the EU, revised his previous testimony, now admitting in a sworn statement that "resumption of the US aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anticorruption statement."</b> The revision is the first time Sondland has admitted that the White House attached conditions to the release of military aide to Ukraine—a big reversal from his original testimony where he repeatedly said he didn't believe that there were. I don't know quite how you can just idly add that in that later and it's all cool, but here we are.

  - item: Even as transcripts are released (and, uh, revised) and the House gears up for public testimony next week, investigators continue to hold closed-door depositions as well—or at least are trying to. <b>While David Hale, under secretary of state for political affairs at the State Department, showed up to testify today, three others, including energy secretary Rick Perry, no-showed.</b> While Perry was not under subpoena, Russel Vought, acting director of the Office of Management and Budget and Ulrich Brechbul, a State Department official who listened to Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian president Zelensky, had both been issued subpoenas after no-showing previously. What to do about all these no-shows? Well, according to the New York Times, Adam Schiff has "indicated he will count refusals to appear as part of an article of impeachment against Mr Trump for obstruction of Congress." K, that works.

  - item: Finally, speaking of subpoenas, <b>House Democrats announced today that they've given up pursuing a subpoena for former deputy national security advisor Charles Kupperman, who had filed a lawsuit asking a judge to determine if he should comply</b>. Earlier this week a judge set a hearing date of December 10th, more than a month away and well into the public phase of the impeachment inquiry. Instead of pursuing this suit, House Democrats told Kupperman's attorney that they hope "Kupperman will comply with an upcoming ruling in a similar case involving former White House counsel Don McGahn." Definitely <i>hoping</i> is going to go great here I'm sure.

  tomorrow: House investigators heard a lot of testimony over the last month, so expect more transcripts to be released this week. Each transcript is hundreds of pages long, so even as new ones are released you can expect further revelations from ones released earlier in the week as well. I mean, who doesn't love transcripts, <i>right</i>? Oh, just me? Well, pretty soon we'll be getting testimony live on TV so I hope nobody had any plans for—<i>checks notes</i>—the entire month of November. <i>Cries.</i>

  yesterday: On September 24, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/democrats-impeachment-trump.html">Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry against President Trump</a> for allegedly withholding aid for Ukraine unless the Ukrainians investigated his political rivals. Over the last few weeks, House investigative committees <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-whistleblower-summary-factb/factbox-the-trump-impeachment-inquiry-what-weve-learned-so-far-idUSKBN1X82BM">have accumulated testimony from many officials</a> that corroborate that narrative (which has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/us/politics/mick-mulvaney-trump-ukraine.html">essentially been corroborated by the White House</a> as well). This week, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/28/house-to-vote-on-resolution-establishing-next-steps-in-impeachment-inquiry-000302">Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced</a> that after the last month of closed-door investigations, the impeachment inquiry would move into a new phase.
  todays: 
  - item: Welcome to the official impeachment inquiry! <b>The House of Representatives voted today to formally authorize the impeachment inquiry that has been underway for the last month and to move it into a new, more public phase.</b> This is only the third time in modern history that the House has voted on an impeachment inquiry of a president, so like, take a moment here. "What is at stake in all of this is nothing less than our democracy," said Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who on Monday introduced this resolution. The resolution outlines the next steps of the impeachment inquiry, now focused heavily on public hearings starting in November which will almost certainly lead to articles of impeachment being filed and a vote taken maybe before the winter holidays. Things just got very real.

  - item: Today's historic vote was also a moment of truth for lawmakers who may have been reluctant to put their names to an impeachment vote. <b>The final vote fell almost entirely on party lines, with 232 voting to approve and 196 opposed</b>. Two Democrats—Collin Peterson of Minnesota and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey—joined every Republican in voting against the resolution. Justin Amash, who left the Republican party earlier this year, voted in favor. If you want to see the whole list of names, the New York Times has a good look at how everyone voted.

According to the Washington Post, <b>Vindman testified that when he raised concerns about the president's July 25 call to White House lawyer John Eisenberg, Eisenberg responded by moving the transcript of the call with the president of Ukraine to a classified server.</b> In case you were wondering, that's "a step that other officials have said is at odds with long-standing White House protocol." Eisenberg has now been asked to testify on Monday. Don't put big money on him showing up.

  - item: But with today's vote, <b>the time of closed-door testimony is coming to a close</b>. "A lot of the damning evidence already came out. And a lot of these witnesses are corroborating essentially the same narrative, which hasn’t changed," Representative Ted Lieu told Politico. While there are still people lined up for testimony, another source said "Given the evidence we’ve collected so far, we think we’re ready to enter a public phase sooner than later." Here we go.

  yesterday: After a month of closed-door impeachment investigations run by House committees, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced this week that the House <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/28/house-to-vote-on-resolution-establishing-next-steps-in-impeachment-inquiry-000302">would take a formal vote on the impeachment inquiry</a> and the inquiry itself would move into a more public stage. On top of that, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/vindman-offers-a-firsthand-account-of-critical-episodes-in-alleged-quid-pro-quo/2019/10/29/cb16a5c0-fa45-11e9-ac8c-8eced29ca6ef_story.html">Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman became the first person present on the call with Donald Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to testify to House investigators</a>. In just his opening statement he backed up the allegations that the president was demanding "that a foreign government investigate a US citizen." We learned more about his testimony today.
  todays: 
  - item: The biggest news of today was further details from yesterday's testimony by Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman. <b>Citing multiple people familiar with Vindman's testimony, the New York Times reported that "the White House transcript of a July call between President Trump and Ukraine’s president omitted crucial words and phrases."</b> <i>Well then</i>. According to the Times, what was left out of the White House transcript "included Mr Trump's assertion that there were recordings of former Vice President Joseph R Biden Jr discussing Ukraine corruption, and an explicit mention by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, of Burisma Holdings, the energy company whose board employed Mr Biden's son Hunter." <i>Oh.</i> That is certainly an omission. 
    source: New York Times

  - item: In addition to learning more about Vindman's testimony, today featured two State Department officials testifying to House investigators. <b>Catherine Croft and Christopher Anderson, who both served as senior advisors on Ukraine, "described to investigators the unusual intrusion into US foreign policy by Trump-aligned consultants, including his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Robert Livingston, a lobbyist and former GOP congressman,"</b> according to Politico. Robert Livingston? <i>A new player has entered the game.</i> In her opening statement, Croft said that Livingston "characterized Ambassador Yovanovitch as an 'Obama holdover' and associated with George Soros." OK... "It was not clear to me at the time—or now—at whose direction or at whose expense Mr. Livingston was seeking the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch." Well he sounds great.

  - item: A third State Department official also appeared on Capitol Hill today. <b>Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan answered multiple impeachment-y questions during a confirmation hearing to become US ambassador to Russia.</b> While a confirmation hearing for an ambassador is not the normal setting for this type of inquiry, Democrats got right to the point with Sullivan. Did Rudy Giuliani try to smear ousted US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch? "I believe he was, yes." Should the president use the power of his office to get foreign countries to investigate political opponents? "I don't think that would be in accord with our values." Has Sullivan ever "heard of any other president asking a foreign government to investigate an American citizen"? According to reports, Sullivan "can't think of one off the top of my head." And so here we are again—it's remarkable how consistent all this testimony keeps ending up being.

  - item: Speaking of testimony (<i>when aren't we</i>), <b>Democrats have officially asked former National Security Advisor John Bolton to appear in the impeachment inquiry next week</b>. The mustachioed advisor has come up multiple times in testimony over the last month and his appearance before impeachment investigators was all but inevitable. Bolton has been reported to have viewed Rudy Giuliani as a "hand grenade" and refused to get involved in "whatever drug deal" US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland and White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney "are cooking up." That Democrats didn't wait until a judge ruled on whether Bolton's former deputy Charles Kupperman would be compelled to testify (a hearing for which was pushed to Friday), is a sign that they think their hand becomes stronger after tomorrow's floor vote on the impeachment resolution introduced yesterday.

  - item: About the vote tomorrow, <b>Democrats emerged from a caucus meeting today and announced that they expected few defections in the vote on the resolution to begin open impeachment proceedings.</b> According to Politico, only five Democrats "have not come out in support of the impeachment inquiry" and only one, Jeff Van Drew who holds a vulnerable seat in New Jersey has said he's leaning toward no. Despite a few potential no votes from Democrats, "I think most of us recognize transparency and articulation of process is in the best interest of the country and for the institution," said Rep Dean Phillips from Minnesota. No Republicans are expected to vote for the resolution. Shocker, I know.

  yesterday: After a month of closed-door testimony investigating the events surrounding President Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky—where it is alleged he held up military aid for Ukraine unless they investigated his political rivals—<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/28/house-to-vote-on-resolution-establishing-next-steps-in-impeachment-inquiry-000302">Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi surprised everyone yesterday with the announcement that she would be introducing a resolution to officially start an impeachment inquiry in the House</a>. So, you know, it was a big day.
  todays: 
  - item: Whoa—we've got an impeachment resolution and a date set for a vote! Now this isn't a vote to impeach the president. Instead the resolution, introduced by Democrats today, sets forward the rules of an official impeachment proceeding—the first step toward likely articles of impeachment. "Following in the footsteps of previous impeachment inquiries," wrote House committee leaders involved in the impeachment inquiry, "the next phase will move from closed depositions to open hearings where the American people will learn firsthand about the president's misconduct." In addition to open hearings, the resolution directs the Intelligence Committee to prepare a report collecting all evidence in the investigation. That report would then be turned over to the Judiciary Committee who would draw up articles of impeachment. There's a long way between here and there though—the resolution will grant Republicans a lot of the things they've asked for, namely being able to issue subpoenas for testimony of their own, and outlines due process rights for the president and his lawyers once the process moves to the Judiciary Committee. A vote on the resolution is set for Halloween—marking the only time that a "<i>do</i> boo, vote" joke could actually sort of work. <i>Sorry not sorry.</i>

If you're not, just the remarkably long title is suitably historic: <i>Directing certain committees to continue their ongoing investigations as part of the existing House of Representatives inquiry into whether sufficient grounds exist for the House of Representatives to exercise its Constitutional power to impeach Donald John Trump, President of the United States of America, and for other purposes.</i>"

  - item: The resolution wasn't the only action in the House today, as Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council's top expert on Ukraine, testified to House investigators. The Iraq war vet, who was awarded the Purple Heart after being wounded by an IED, is the first White House official who was actually on the July 25 call between President Trump and Ukrainian president Zelensky to testify to House investigators. His verdict? "I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a US citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the US government's support of Ukraine," he said in his opening statement. "I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained. This would all undermine US national security." Yes, yes it would.

  - item: Meanwhile, the lawsuit filed on Friday by former National Security Council deputy Charles Kupperman—who asked a judge to decide if he should abide by House subpoena or White House demands of non-cooperation—has had a hearing set for the suitably spooky date of October 31. US District Judge Richard Leon said that "due to the time-sensitive nature of the issues raised in this case" he was speeding up the process. A decision in the House's favor would probably mean that they would then call former National Security Advisor John Bolton, who is represented by the same attorney as Kupperman and whose name has come up repeatedly in testimony as someone deeply critical of the president's actions toward Ukraine. Halloween is going to be a hell of a day.

"Delay in this case would not only hinder the House's ability to consider impeachment quickly, but also enhance DOJ's ability to run out the clock on the Committee's impeachment inquiry altogether," wrote House lawyers in their filing.

As Politico reports, Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan is due to be vetted by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday because he's up for a vote to become US ambassador to Russia. <i>What timing.</i> "Senate Democratic aides say Sullivan can expect questions about what role Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, played in shaping Ukraine policy." <i>Ya think?</i> "They'll also want to know what, if anything, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did to rein in Giuliani and other outside actors—as well as Trump—as they sought to pressure Ukraine's government to investigate former vice president Joe Biden."

  yesterday: Last week was a dramatic one for the impeachment inquiry. We learned about the testimony of Bill Taylor, who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/opening-statement-of-ambassador-william-b-taylor/6b3a6edf-f976-4081-ba7f-bce45468a3ff/">outlined a coordinated, multi-month effort by the White House to pressure Ukraine into investigating Democrats</a>. But also there was the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/23/impeachment-republicans-trump-055688">Republican pizza protest inside a secure facility</a> in the House and Senator Lindsay Graham's <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/24/lindsey-graham-resolution-trump-impeachment-inquiry/4088121002/">Senate resolution</a> condemning the impeachment inquiry. And then on Friday, a federal judge upended all that by <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2019gj0048-46">declaring the House's inquiry to be legal</a> in a larger ruling that also demanded that the House get access to grand jury materials from the Mueller investigation. Got all that?
  todays: 
  - item: The impeachment inquiry is suddenly entering a new phase this week with the surprise announcement this afternoon by Nancy Pelosi that the House will be introducing a resolution—potentially as soon as <i>tomorrow</i>—that will set procedural guidelines for public hearings, subpoenas, and what "due process" for the president will look like. "We are taking this step to eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump Administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas, or continue obstructing the House of Representatives," Speaker Pelosi wrote today. Whether or not it'll accomplish those things is up in the air but either way it is moving fast—a vote is set for <i>Thursday</i>. Hold on to your butts.

  - item: If the expectation by Democrats is that this resolution will hamper the White House's attack line that the impeachment is "illegitimate," well, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham quickly dispelled that by issuing a statement saying that the impeachment inquiry was "completely and irreversibly illegitimate." As if to underline that "irreversible" is the new talking point, Senator Lindsey Graham took to Twitter to declare that "a vote now is a bit like un-ringing a bell." Damned if you don't, damned if you do I guess. Expect to hear this line of "irreversible" criticism a lot in the next 48 hours.

  - item: Meanwhile, former White House national security deputy Charles Kupperman no-showed his scheduled deposition this morning. Kupperman had filed a lawsuit on Friday asking for judicial guidance on whether he should follow the White House's demand he not cooperate or the subpoena from the House. Kupperman's lawyer has asked for expedited consideration of the lawsuit, but so far there's no timing set and so Kupperman didn't show up. Complicating things further, Kupperman's lawyer is Charles Cooper who also represents mustachioed former National Security Advisor John Bolton, who Democrats would very much like to talk to but right now they'll be waiting on this judge's decision instead.

  - item: And in even more waiting-on-judges news, Friday's decision by a federal district judge that the Department of Justice turn over grand jury materials from the Mueller report to House impeachment investigators has now been appealed to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. You're shocked, I know—go ahead and catch your breath or something. The DOJ had been given a deadline of this Wednesday to turn over the documents. Obviously, in their appeal they are asking for a suspension of that deadline. Who doesn't love waiting for judges?

Glad he cleared that up. <i>Cries</i>.

  tomorrow: Well, up until Pelosi's announcement of a <i>floor vote on impeachment</i> happening this week, I'd say that the main things to watch would be the three other depositions currently scheduled and the potential of a judicial decision on Kupperman's testimony. But now that there's a floor vote  scheduled for Thursday, I'd assume that this week will get quite a bit wackier. Here we go.
- date: 2019-10-27
  yesterday: Last week the impeachment inquiry was a real roller coaster. It opened with explosive testimony by acting US ambassador to Ukraine Bill Tayor who said he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/opening-statement-of-ambassador-william-b-taylor/6b3a6edf-f976-4081-ba7f-bce45468a3ff/">was witness to a coordinated, multi-month effort to pressure Ukraine into investigating Democrats</a>. After that testimony, Republican House members <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/23/impeachment-republicans-trump-055688">stormed the secured testimony room and ate pizza</a> while Senator Lindsay Graham <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/24/lindsey-graham-resolution-trump-impeachment-inquiry/4088121002/">introduced a Senate resolution</a> condemning the impeachment inquiry, saying it was illegitimate. But then on Friday, a federal judge upended that by <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2019gj0048-46">declaring the House's inquiry to be legal</a> in a larger ruling that also demanded that the House get access to grand jury materials from the Mueller investigation. Somehow that work week was five days long like any other. Which brings us to this weekend.
  todays: 
  - item: House investigative committees were back in session on Saturday, after being closed Thursday and Friday for memorials for Representative Elijah Cummings. Nobody likes working on Saturday—especially Republicans, who wrote a letter of complaint—but State Department acting assistant secretary for Europe, Phillip Reeker, showed up and testified for over eight hours. According to Bloomberg, in his testimony, Reeker said he was "disappointed Secretary of State Michael Pompeo didn’t back the US ambassador to Ukraine when she was targeted in a smear campaign by President Donald Trump and his associates." The closed door testimony was "a much richer reservoir of information than we originally expected," Democratic Rep Stephen Lynch said—for eight hours on a Saturday, I'd sure hope so.

  - item: As the pace of testimony picks up again this week, the White House's blanket refusal to cooperate with the investigation is the focus of a lawsuit filed on Friday by Charles Kupperman. Kupperman, deputy to former national security advisor John Bolton, wants a judge to decide whether he should listen to the White House, who doesn't want him to testify, or comply with the subpoena from the House. "Plaintiff obviously cannot satisfy the competing demands of both the Legislative and Executive Branches," the lawsuit reads, "and he is aware of no controlling judicial authority definitively establishing which Branch’s command should prevail." Obviously this lawsuit has implications far beyond Kupperman, who is scheduled to be deposed tomorrow, and a decision in either direction will have major repercussions moving forward.

  - item: House Democrats responded to Kupperman's lawsuit on Saturday saying that it is "lacking in legal merit and apparently coordinated with the White House." And, in a refrain that is both familiar and as yet unenforced, said that failure to show up on Monday "will constitute evidence that may be used against him in a contempt proceeding." But, you know, don't hold your breath—so far House Democrats have yet to enforce a single subpoena.

  - item: Meanwhile, we're still learning more about testimony from the people who have shown up over the last few weeks. The Wall Street Journal yesterday reported on more details from the testimony of US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland, who has emerged as a central figure in all this. Citing Sondland's lawyer directly, the Journal reported that during his testimony on October 17 when asked whether the president withholding aid from Ukraine in return for political favors "was a quid pro quo, Mr. Sondland cautioned that he wasn’t a lawyer but said he believed the answer was yes." I am also not a lawyer, but I will say <i>ohhhhhhh</i>.

  - item: Finally, the Washington Post has a revealing look at what Republicans have been asking during all these depositions. Remember, while Republicans have been pushing the narrative this week that they've been locked out of the proceedings, there are 48 Republican members of the three committees leading this stage of the impeachment inquiry. And it turns out their focus has been on—wait for it—unmasking the whistleblower. During testimony, "GOP members and staffers have repeatedly raised the name of a person suspected of filing the whistleblower complaint," the Post reports. Which definitely seems like a normal line of questioning about—<i>checks notes</i>—the president's conduct. Anyway, testimony picks up the pace again this week so expect much more of this to come.

  tomorrow: Things get interesting fast this week, with Charles Kupperman's testimony scheduled for Monday running up against the lawsuit he filed on Friday so, <i>waves hands</i>. After those potential legal fireworks tomorrow, there is testimony scheduled throughout the week, including from White House national security advisor Tim Morrison on Thursday. Morrison's lawyers announced last week he will defy the White House and comply with the subpoena. Strap in. 
- date: 2019-10-25
  yesterday: The last few days of the impeachment inquiry have been dominated by Republicans trying to wrest the narrative away from Democrats. First, House Republicans <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/23/impeachment-republicans-trump-055688">stormed the secure space for testimony and ate pizza</a>, really. Then, yesterday, Senator Lindsay Graham <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/24/lindsey-graham-resolution-trump-impeachment-inquiry/4088121002/">introduced a Senate resolution condemning the impeachment inquiry</a>. Both these actions followed the Tuesday testimony by acting US ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/opening-statement-of-ambassador-william-b-taylor/6b3a6edf-f976-4081-ba7f-bce45468a3ff/">outlined a multi-month effort to pressure Ukraine into investigating the president's political rivals</a>. So there's that. Anyway, that Republican narrative is important as we go into today...
  todays: 
  - item: The Republican talking point that the impeachment inquiry underway in the House is "illegitimate" was dealt a significant blow today after dominating the narrative this week. In a ruling related to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election (more on that in a second), federal judge Beryl A Howell found that Department of Justice arguments that the House needed to pass a resolution authorizing a formal impeachment proceeding was "cherry-picked and incomplete." The US District Court judge went on to say "more significantly, this test has no textual support in the US Constitution." Judge Howell goes on to cite cases of non-presidential impeachment inquiries in the House that proceeded without a House resolution but, she adds "even in cases of presidential impeachment, a House resolution has never, in fact, been required to begin an impeachment inquiry." <i>Well then.</i>

  - item: Believe it or not, declaring the impeachment inquiry legal was only a side quest in Judge Howell's decision. The rest was a big deal too, seeing as how she ordered that the Department of Justice turn over certain grand jury materials from Robert Mueller's investigation to the House Judiciary Committee—<i>by Wednesday</i>. The Judiciary Committee had sued this summer to release the redacted portions of Mueller's final report along with grand jury materials cited in the report. The grand jury material, usually secret, should be made available to House investigators because the "House was legally engaged in a judicial process that exempts Congress from normal grand jury secrecy rules," the Washington Post reported. Even if the impeachment inquiry remains focused on Ukraine, one would expect that grand jury material regarding Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort's work in Ukraine would be of interest. House investigators would get those on Wednesday, barring a DOJ appeal to the Supreme Court, which, <i>stares at you, eyebrows raised</i>.

  - item: All of this may complicate the job of the person at the White House in charge of counter-messaging the impeachment inquiry—that is, if they had one. Politico today looks at the search for a "communications guru" to handle point on the impeachment at the White House. "They are trying to figure out how to set up a war room, without it being a war room and without it devolving into a civil war inside the White House," Politico reported. Well, it's good to know what you want. And also that it's what you don't want. And also that it might kick off a civil war. Sounds reasonable.

  - item: Speaking of the White House, lawyers for Tim Morrison, a National Security Council advisor on Russia and Europe, announced today that he would testify to House investigative committees next week. Morrison's testimony would be the first from someone that actually listened in on the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian president Zelensky. Despite Morrison's White House role—and the White House's blanket refusal to cooperate with the inquiry—Morrison's lawyer says he will testify. "He's going to answer questions. That's where we're at right now," his lawyer told CNN. "We haven't made final decisions on anything other than he'll appear with the subpoena." Morrison will testify next Thursday and will be one of at least four officials testifying next week as the House gets back to business after pausing Thursday and Friday for Elijah Cummings' memorial services.

  - item: Last, <i>but certainly not least</i>, Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, butt dialed a reporter from NBC late last night. <i>Catches breath</i>. The call, which came in after 11pm, went to voice mail. Over the three minute message, "Giuliani can be heard discussing overseas dealings and lamenting the need for cash, though it's difficult to discern the full context of the conversation." Back up a second—<i>the need for cash??</i> "The problem is we need some money," Giuliani is overheard saying to an unidentified second person. After an extended silence from both people, he follows up with "We need a few hundred thousand." <i>Oh</i>. It's worth noting that <i>before he was the president's personal lawyer</i>, Guiliani served as cybersecurity advisor to Trump and, more recently, was paid a half-million dollars by Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman's company Fraud Guarantee (<i>stares</i>) for cybersecurity consulting. But he's butt dialing reporters late at night because that is a totally normal and chill thing that all cybersecurity experts/lawyers to the president definitely do. <i>Help me</i>.

You know, like happens. 
  todays: 
  - item: Following yesterday's pizza party/raid on the secure facility, Republicans continued to assail the impeachment process today. This time it was Senate Republican Lindsay Graham picking up the mantle by introducing a resolution condemning the impeachment inquiry. The resolution calls on the House to hold a formal vote on opening an impeachment inquiry. In a press conference that accompanied the introduction of the resolution, Graham said that "I'm not here to tell you that Donald Trump has done nothing wrong," but that he deserves the same rights "as Clinton and Nixon." I've heard fuller-throated endorsements in my time, but OK. The resolution is not yet scheduled for a vote in the Senate.

  - item: House Republicans—whose pizza party (I'm not getting over it, <i>sorry</i>) delayed testimony by over five hours—weren't the only ones attempting to block yesterday's testimony of Laura Cooper, deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia. Far more serious was the letter written by the Department of Defense to Cooper's lawyers prior to her testimony that warned her against testifying. The New York Times got ahold of the letter and annotates it fully. It's a good look into how the administration attempts to pressure people to not testify. After receiving a subpoena from the House, Cooper testified. "The letter leaves ambiguous whether such actions would be insubordinate."

The testimony, which lasted three hours, is expected to 'fill in details of an explosive aspect of Democrats' impeachment inquiry: whether Trump withheld nearly $400 million in military aid for Ukraine to pressure the ally’s new president.' While Democrats present at the testimony didn't give further details, Republican Mark Meadows—you know one of the 48 Republicans with access—said that 'elements of her testimony conflicted' with the Tuesday testimony of William Taylor."

  - item: Finally, regular business was halted at the House for the next two days to accommodate memorials for Representative Elijah Cummings, whose death last week cast a long shadow over this week's impeachment proceedings.

  yesterday: Yesterday all eyes were on the testimony of acting US ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor. Taylor's testimony, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/us/trump-impeachment-ukraine.html">which drew from extensive notes</a> from conversations he had with many people wrapped up in the impeachment inquiry, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/opening-statement-of-ambassador-william-b-taylor/6b3a6edf-f976-4081-ba7f-bce45468a3ff/">outlined a months-long, coordinated process</a> by members of the White House, the State Department, and Rudy Giuliani, to pressure Ukraine to investigate Democrats in return for military aid. The explosive testimony set up what looked to be a tense day on Capitol Hill. Well, we didn't know the half of it.
  todays: 
  - item: Chaos reigned at the impeachment proceedings today, as House Republicans stormed the secure room House investigative committees were using for depositions. <i>No, really</i>. According to Politico, "GOP lawmakers who do not sit on the three committees leading the inquiry initially refused to leave the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) in the basement of the Capitol, prompting a standoff with Democrats that ultimately led the House’s sergeant-at-arms to intervene." They even ordered pizza while they occupied the room. <i>Stares right at the camera.</i> In addition to the occupation and the pizza, many of the lawmakers entered the secure room with cell phones, which is strictly forbidden what with it <i>being a secure room in the basement of the United States Capitol Building</i>. I mean, <i>come on now</i>. The protest was in retaliation for what Republicans feel is an unfair closed door proceeding—even though the 48 Republicans on the three investigating committees have full access to the depositions and their lawyers have equal time to question witnesses, so like, shruggie emoji, I got nothing. Do your thing guys, I guess.

  - item: The "mechanics" of that blocked aid to Ukraine was the focus of a New York Times investigation today which revealed that "Ukraine was aware the White House was holding up the funds weeks earlier than United States and Ukrainian officials had acknowledged." The White House has maintained that the Ukrainians didn't know aid had been withheld, and thusly they could not have been pressured into making a deal to release it. But the Times reports that "word of the aid freeze had gotten to high-level Ukrainian officials by the first week in August," so probably someone's got some explaining to do.

  yesterday: This week got started with a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/21/acting-head-of-omb-refuses-to-testify-in-house-impeachment-probe-053256">shuffling of the calendar</a> to accommodate memorials for Rep Elijah Cummings, <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/features/bs-fe-elijah-cummings-mentorship-20191017-ars4uy3d5reovmaljtb5drnvxm-story.html">whose unexpected death last week</a>, and his role as the chair of the House Oversight Committee, continues to have ripple effects on the impeachment inquiry. As a result, only two testimonies are currently scheduled. However, today's was a big one so let's just get right to it.
  todays:  
  - item: William Taylor, the US chargé d'affaires (the fancy term for "acting ambassador") for Ukraine testified to House investigative committees today over the protest of the State Department, who attempted to block his testimony this morning. Working from extensive notes, Taylor is reported to have "sketched out in remarkable detail a quid-pro-quo pressure campaign on Ukraine that Mr Trump and his allies have long denied, one in which the president conditioned the entire United States relationship with Ukraine on a promise that the country would investigate former Vice President Joseph R Biden Jr and his family, along with other Democrats." Taylor's testimony⁠—which we will almost certainly learn more about in the coming days⁠—directly contradicts the president's assertion that there was "no quid pro quo" between US aid and political investigations by Ukraine. In actuality, according to the New York Times the testimony drew a "direct line" between foreign aid and Trump's political aims.

  - item: While we don't know much about the substance of Taylor's testimony yet, his 15 page opening statement has leaked and it paints a very clear picture of a months-long campaign involving EU ambassador Gordon Sondland, US special representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker (both of whom have already testified to House committees), and Rudy Giuliani to get Ukraine to capitulate to President Trump's demands in return for military aid. The statement, which paints a timeline stretching back to Ukrainian president Zelensky's election, describes a "weird combination of encouraging, confusing, and ultimately alarming circumstances."

  - item: Speaking of Kurt Volker, US special envoy to Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal today reports on a meeting between Volker and Ukrainian president Zelensky in Toronto on July second, weeks before Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky. Volker "pulled Mr. Zelensky aside at a conference in Toronto on July 2 to urge him to make clear his commitment to investigating corruption and alleged 2016 election interference," you know, like you do in secret at a conference. This report, along with Taylor's opening statement, certainly stretches the timeline far out from Trump's "perfect" call with the Ukrainian president in late July.

  - item: 'Meanwhile, this morning Donald Trump lashed out at the impeachment proceedings saying "all Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here—a lynching." <i>Stares.</i> As you... <i>Stares again</i>. As you might expect, this particular line of ahistorical attack did not go over well with almost anyone, prompting rare condemnation even from Republicans. "Given the history of this in our country, I would not compare it to a lynching,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. "That was an unfortunate choice of words." Democratic Representative Danny Davis was far more blunt in his assessment: "What the hell is wrong with you?" he asked. "Do you know how many people who look like me have been lynched, since the inception of this country, by people who look like you. Delete this tweet."'

  - item: Finally, the New York Times reported last night that House Democrats have extended their timeline for impeachment proceedings—now expected to stretch to at least the end of the year. Why? Well, "after a complicated web of damaging revelations about the president has emerged from private depositions unfolding behind closed doors, Democratic leaders have now begun plotting a full-scale—and probably more time-consuming—effort to lay out their case in a set of high-profile public hearings on Capitol Hill." So I guess we'll be together for a while longer still. I work for tips. Lololol. <i>Cries</i>.

  tomorrow: Due to yesterday's announcement that the House will be closed for regular business Thursday and Friday to memorialize Rep Elijah Cummings, tomorrow is the last "real" day of the impeachment inquiry and features the testimony of DOD official Laura Cooper. We'll probably learn more about both Taylor and Cooper's testimonies in the days ahead, which should definitely prompt very chill responses from the president I am sure. 
- date: 2019-10-21
  yesterday: Last week ended with White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/us/politics/mick-mulvaney-trump-ukraine.html">admitting at a press conference</a> that President Trump had linked Ukrainian military aid with investigating his political rivals. Unsurprisingly that statement was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/mulvaney-acknowledges-trump-held-ukraine-aid-political-reasons-get-over-n1068256">rapidly retracted</a> but has proven to have <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/18/mick-mulvaney-press-briefing-050855">staying power</a>. Mulvaney's statement followed a productive week of testimony in the house that further revealed the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/17/gordon-sondland-to-break-from-trump-in-impeachment-testimony-000288">depth of Rudy Giuliani's role</a> in Ukrainian affairs. Finally, on a solemn note, the week also ended with the <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/features/bs-fe-elijah-cummings-mentorship-20191017-ars4uy3d5reovmaljtb5drnvxm-story.html">unexpected passing</a> of Rep Elijah Cummings. It was a very full week.  
  todays: 
  - item: This week began with a shuffling of the agenda. While House investigators had planned for testimony of upwards of <i>nine</i> officials over the next five days, but plans have changed to accommodate memorials following the death last week of House Oversight Committee Chair Rep Elijah Cummings. Cummings will lie in state in the Capitol on Thursday with a funeral service on Friday. As a result, many depositions have been postponed. However, House investigative committees are still expected to hear from William Taylor, acting ambassador to Ukraine, and Laura Cooper, who oversees Ukraine and Russia issues at the Department of Defense on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively. Taylor—who in text messages released a few weeks ago, said it was "crazy" to link Ukraine aide to political investigations—is the testimony to watch this week, even before the schedule was trimmed.

  - item: Two other officials that were slated to testify this week made the House's reshuffling a bit easier, if we're defining "easier" as "defying subpoenas." Acting head of the Office of Management and Budget Russ Vought took to Twitter today to declare "I saw some Fake News over the weekend to correct. As the WH letter made clear two weeks ago, OMB officials--myself and Mike Duffey--will not be complying with deposition requests this week." He closed with the hashtag "shamprocess" Which I read as "Shamp Rocess" twice before I got it.

  - item: In case you were worried that maybe nothing was getting done in the House today, you'll be glad to know that House Republicans are working to force a vote censuring House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff tonight. The resolution, introduced by Arizona Republican Andy Biggs, says that Schiff "manufactured a false retelling" of the President's call with Ukrainian president Zelensky. The resolution goes on to say that Schiff's actions "make a mockery of the impeachment process, one of this chamber’s most solemn constitutional duties." Which OK, sure guy, that's definitely the thing making a mockery of the process glad you're on it.

  - item: Meanwhile, Donald Trump talked to press at a cabinet meeting today, where he claimed the House is "interviewing ambassadors who I’d never heard of." House investigators have talked with the current ambassador to the European Union, the former ambassador to Ukraine, and tomorrow will talk with the current acting ambassador to Ukraine. One would expect that Trump knows who these people are and yet, "I don’t know who these people are. I never heard of them." <i>I'm exhausted</i>.

  - item: And finally in the same cabinet meeting, President Trump once again attacked the whistleblower who kicked off the impeachment investigation nearly a month ago. Those attacks caused Senator Chuck Schumer to ask "both the acting director of national intelligence and the inspector general on Monday afternoon to outline what 'specific steps' they are taking to protect the whistleblower" in case the president or others identify them. Which is normal and chill for sure.

  tomorrow: With the change of schedule in the House, there are far less depositions happening, but William "it's crazy to withhold security assistance" Taylor's testimony tomorrow should be well worth watching out for (if it leaks) and Laura Cooper later in the week should shed more light on the holdback of Ukrainian military aid this summer. Beyond that, what had been gearing up to be a wild week may end up more subdued. Ahaahahaa who am I kidding crying emoji. 
- date: 2019-10-20
  yesterday: Week four of the impeachment inquiry took a weird turn on Thursday. The week saw a steady drumbeat of testimony in the House that filled out our understanding of who (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trumps-former-top-russia-adviser-to-testify-in-house-impeachment-probe/2019/10/14/e6015c1c-ee34-11e9-8693-f487e46784aa_story.html">Rudy</a>) was deeply involved in running US-Ukrainian policy (yep, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/17/gordon-sondland-to-break-from-trump-in-impeachment-testimony-000288">pretty much all Rudy</a>) that was matched by a steady drumbeat of <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/white-house-budget-office-defies-house-impeachment-subpoena-for-ukraine-documents">denying</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/defense-secretary-mark-esper-will-no-longer-comply-impeachment-inquiry-n1067226?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_np">subpoenas</a> by the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/pence-refuses-house-request-provide-documents-related-ukraine-call-n1066651">White House</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/RudyGiuliani/status/1184204275267854338">and others</a>. That would have been that until Mick Mulvaney, White House Chief of Staff, held a press conference on Thursday where he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/us/politics/mick-mulvaney-trump-ukraine.html">casually confirmed that Ukrainian aid was tied to cooperation with the president's investigation of Democrats</a>. You know, like you do. He's been walking it back ever since. 
  todays: 
  - item: Details from the last week of testimony continues to leak out. On Saturday we learned that George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, told House investigators that Rudy Giuliani pushed the State Department to issue a visa to former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin. Shokin was forced out of his job in 2016 due to massive corruption, but Giuliani wanted to interview him about, guess what, the Democrats. When State denied the visa, Kent testified, Giuliani "then appealed to the White House to have State reverse its decision." Remarkably, they didn't.

  - item: Additional reverberations from last week hit yesterday when Republican Representative Francis Rooney—who <i>just Friday</i> was critical of White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney's Thursday press conference saying Mulvaney "basically said it was a quid pro quo" and that he wouldn't rule out voting for impeachment—suddenly announced Saturday he was retiring in 2020.

  - item: The field of Republicans willing to speak up about impeachment is not particularly large (it's less a field and more a patch of sod), but John Kasich, the—<i>checks notes</i>—former Governor of Ohio, joined that small group yesterday. "If you are asking me if I was sitting in the House of Representatives today and you were to ask me how do I feel, do I think impeachment should move forward and should go for a full examination and a trial in the United States Senate, my vote would be yes," he told CNN. Any port in a storm I guess.

  - item: Finally, Mick Mulvaney attempted once again to walk back his disastrous press conference. Sunday morning he joined the friendly confines of Fox News Sunday to further clarify. In a rambling answer he admitted once again that "the president did mention to me from time to time about the DNC server, he mentioned the DNC server to other people publically, he even mentioned it to president Zelensky in the phone call," before adding that "it wasn't connected to the aid" to Ukraine. K Mick, thanks for clearing that right up.

  tomorrow: It's going to be a potentially very busy week in the House, with currently <i>nine</i> testimonies or depositions scheduled. Considering the White House's stance of non-cooperation, we'll see how many of those actually happen but just for context that's twice as many as happened this past week so I hope you are strapped in. 
- date: 2019-10-18
  yesterday: Yesterday was one of the wilder days since the impeachment inquiry kicked off. Between Mick Mulvaney admitting that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/us/politics/mick-mulvaney-trump-ukraine.html">president held up aid</a> to Ukraine in return for political favors, US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland saying that <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/17/gordon-sondland-to-break-from-trump-in-impeachment-testimony-000288">he was directed</a> to run Ukraine policy through Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, and Energy Secretary Rick Perry <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/rick-perry-called-rudy-giuliani-at-trumps-direction-on-ukraine-concerns-11571273635?redirect=amp#click=https://t.co/sIxFA6eT4Z">saying the same thing</a>, you would think that today would be off like a shot. Well... 
  todays: 
  - item: The reverberations of yesterday's press conference with White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney⁠—where he admitted to linking military aid for Ukraine with Ukraine investigating Democrats (and that people should "get over it")⁠—continued to ripple out. While Donald Trump has so far stood by his chief of staff, his go-to conservative pundit Sean Hannity told his radio listeners "I just think he’s dumb, I really do." On Capitol Hill, even a few Republican lawmakers spoke out. "You don’t hold up foreign aid that we had previously appropriated for a political initiative. Period," said Senator Lisa Murkowski. Rep Francis Rooney of Florida was even more outspoken, saying that Mulvaney "basically said it was a quid pro quo," adding "it’s not an etch a sketch, it's kind of hard to argue that he didn't say it, right?" Yep, you're definitely right about that.

  - item: But Republican leadership continues to hold the line despite Mulvaney's admissions yesterday. In a press conference today, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy came to his defense saying "I think Mick Mulvaney clarified his statement to be very clear. I take Mick Mulvaney at his word for clarification." Which I mean, OK you do you man.

  - item: And to wrap up the week with what has been the White House's ongoing theme, outgoing Energy Secretary Rick Perry today told House investigative committees that he won't comply with a subpoena for documents that had a deadline for today. Democrats had sought documents pertaining to Perry's involvement in Ukraine but, nope, the Energy Department is "unable to comply with your request for documents and communications at this time." Democrats might want to figure out a strategy for enforcing subpoenas but I'm not holding my breath at this point.

  tomorrow: Well if today ended up being what qualifies for "chill" around here, then certainly that'll just ride out through the weekend right? Please? Five testimonies are set for next week, plus document deadlines, and maybe the Democrats will enforce a subpoena I think I close out every week with that last one <i>wheee</i>. Weekend!

  yesterday: A week of closed-door testimony by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/us/mckinley-impeachment-ukraine.html">State Department officials</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/14/us/politics/bolton-giuliani-fiona-hill-testimony.html#click=https://t.co/rTwBWk6HUI">National Security aides</a> has given a broader understanding of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/us/politics/gordon-sondland-intelligence-risk.html">pressure exerted on diplomats</a> by the White House and the president's personal lawyer, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trumps-former-top-russia-adviser-to-testify-in-house-impeachment-probe/2019/10/14/e6015c1c-ee34-11e9-8693-f487e46784aa_story.html">Rudy Giuliani</a>. At the same time, the White House has <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/defense-secretary-mark-esper-will-no-longer-comply-impeachment-inquiry-n1067226?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_np">continued</a> to <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/white-house-budget-office-defies-house-impeachment-subpoena-for-ukraine-documents">blockade documents</a> from being turned over to investigators. It's been a tense week. And then today happened. 
  todays: 
  - item: Today opened with the somber news of the death of Representative Elijah Cummings. Cummings has played a key role in the impeachment inquiry as the chair of the House Oversight Committee. But more than that, he represented his west Baltimore district for over two decades, earning the respect of those he worked with and represented. "I don’t expect to change the world," he said when he won his first race for the Maryland House of Delegates in 1983 (he moved to the US House in 1996). “I’m just ready to get to work." He did the work.

  - item: The sober news of the morning, however, was quickly replaced by one of the wilder moments since the impeachment inquiry kicked off just over three weeks ago. White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney held a press conference to announce that next year's G7 summit, a yearly meeting of world leaders, will be held at the Trump Doral golf club in Miami (<i>stares directly into camera</i>). You would think that would be the update, but in fact the update is that at the presser, Mulvaney was asked about the president's call with Ukraine and the connection between investigating the Democrats and the withholding of $400 million in military aid to the country. Did the president "mention to me in passing the corruption related to the DNC server?" Mulvaney asked rhetorically. "Absolutely. No question about that." Then he added "and that's why we held up the money." When asked, point blank, if this was a quid-pro-quo, he responded "We do that all the time," later telling reporters to "get over it. There's going to be political influence in foreign policy." <i>Help. Me. I. Am. Dying. Inside.</i>

"The president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server," he wrote a few hours later. OK Mick thanks for clearing that up.

  - item: Given the relentless nature of today's news cycle, it's easy to forget that US ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland, testified to House investigative committees today. Considering what a central figure he has emerged as over the last few days of testimony and the role he played in last week's White House blockade of the inquiry, it's remarkable that he's not the biggest story of the day. In his opening statements, which have leaked, Sondland testified he was directed by the president to involve Rudy Giuliani in Ukrainian affairs. It was only "much later" that he realized "Mr. Giuliani’s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son or to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the President's 2020 reelection campaign." Somehow this is not the most remarkable thing that a person said today by a mile.

Rick Perry, who tonight officially announced he is resigning as Energy Secretary, told the Wall Street Journal that he was directed by Trump this spring to get on the phone with Giuliani. On the call, according to the Journal, Giuliani "blamed Ukraine for the dossier about Mr. Trump's alleged ties to Russia that was created by a former British intelligence officer and asserted that Ukraine had Mrs. Clinton's email server and 'dreamed up' evidence that helped send former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to jail." <i>Gestures wildly in every direction.</i>

  tomorrow: Somehow, impossibly, there is another day in the work week. The White House has a deadline to turn over documents to House investigators tomorrow, so that should go real legal and real cool. And probably 10,000 other things will happen. <i>Whelp.</i>

  yesterday: House investigators have kept busy in the fourth week of the impeachment inquiry, keeping up a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/14/us/politics/who-is-fiona-hill.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage">daily pace</a> of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/us/politics/impeachment-george-kent-state.html#click=https://t.co/KvMLoN2AoY">closed-door testimony</a>. The White House has continued to resist the inquiry this week, with <a href="https://twitter.com/RudyGiuliani/status/1184204275267854338">multiple people</a> defying subpoenas to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/pence-refuses-house-request-provide-documents-related-ukraine-call-n1066651">turn over documents</a>. These two themes of testimony and defiance are going to continue in parallel all week. Maybe all time. To infinity and beyond. 
  todays: 
  - item: 'The week of testimony continued in the House today with investigating committees hearing from Michael McKinley, former senior advisor to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. McKinley abruptly quit his position last week. "The timing of my resignation was the result of two overriding concerns: the failure, in my view, of the State Department to offer support to foreign service employees caught up in the impeachment inquiry on Ukraine," McKinley is reported to have said in his opening statement, "and, second, by what appears to be the utilization of our ambassadors overseas to advance a domestic political objective."'

In the latest information to leak, Hill described Gordon Sondland, US ambassador to the EU as "a potential national security risk because he was so unprepared for his job" and that he was "metaphorically driving in an unfamiliar place with no guardrails and no GPS."

Yesterday Defense Secretary Mark Esper refused to turn over subpoenaed documents pertaining to the Ukrainian aide package that was held back at the president's direction this summer.

  - item: The Defense Secretary's refusal wasn't the only one from yesterday. In addition to no documents from VP Mike Pence and Rudy Giuliani (which were covered in yesterday's update), the Office of Management and Budget was also supposed to produce documents pertaining to Ukrainian aid and they too refused, citing the same old refrain.

Anyway, speaking of that guy, the Washington Post today pegs him as a key facilitator of the July 25 call, including tricking National Security Advisor John Bolton into thinking he was giving a solo briefing to Trump before the Ukraine call when actually Trump immediately followed the Bolton call with a secret briefing by Gordon Sondland (there's that name again) because why not."

He was scheduled last week too and was blocked by the White House, but his lawyers triple swear he'll be there tomorrow. There's also the question of the subpoena to Mick Mulvaney for White House documents, but I think we know how that one's going to turn out. Somehow tomorrow is only Thursday.

  yesterday: Week four of the impeachment inquiry started yesterday with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/14/us/politics/who-is-fiona-hill.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage">testimony of Fiona Hill</a>, a former NSC senior official for Russia and Europe. Hill's testimony was the first of a full week of testimony scheduled in the House. This is in stark contrast to last week's impeachment news which largely centered around the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/08/white-house-formally-tells-democrats-it-wont-cooperate-with-impeachment-probe-000279">White House's refusal to cooperate</a> (and the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/two-foreign-born-men-who-helped-giuliani-on-ukraine-arrested-on-campaign-finance-charges-11570714188?mod=hp_lead_pos1">arrest of Rudy Giuliani's associates</a>, which is quite a thing to stuff in a parenthetical I know). Anyway, people are cooperating and we're learning... things. Let's get to it.  
  todays: 
  - item: We learned quite a bit more about National Security Counsel senior official Fiona Hill's testimony late last night and this morning. Hill, who spent <i>ten hours</i> testifying on the Hill yesterday, said that Rudy Giuliani "ran a shadow foreign policy in Ukraine that circumvented US officials and career diplomats." And that John Bolton, National Security Advisor, told her to raise her concerns with White House lawyers. Wanna guess how that went?

  - item: Hill's testimony about John Bolton was eyebrow-raising enough that it warrants its own bullet point. Hill testified that Bolton told her that he didn't want to have any part of "whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up," and that Giuliani was "a hand grenade who’s going to blow everybody up." One would expect a subpoena may be heading Bolton's way soon.

  - item: Hill was the first of an entire week of testimony scheduled at the House. Today saw State Department Ukraine policy head George Kent testify. Arriving at the hearing in a bow tie, it is expected that Kent would expand on leaked State Department emails he authored that warned about Giuliani's work in Ukraine and that attempts to smear former US ambassador to Ukraine Maria Yovanovitch were "complete poppycock," which is an adorable way to put it.

  - item: Speaking of Rudy Giuliani, today was his deadline to turn over documents to House investigative committees. Surprise! He refused. In a letter authored by lawyer Jon Sale, he called the impeachment inquiry "unconstitutional" and said that the request was "beyond the scope of a legitimate inquiry." Despite the letter being written by a lawyer, in a tweet that accompanied the letter Giuliani himself said, "I do not need a lawyer." Which, <i>waves hands in all directions</i>, OK let's just go with it.

  - item: And in other refusing-to-produce-documents news, shortly after Giuliani posted his refusal (which was to a subpoena) VP Mike Pence followed suit and also refused to produce documents (which were requested, but not subpoenaed). In wording that echoed Giuliani's, Pence's refusal called into question the legitimacy of the inquiry. "Never before in history has the Speaker of the House attempted to launch an 'impeachment inquiry' against a president without the majority of the House of Representatives voting to authorize a constitutionally acceptable process." Mike Pence, it should be noted, has a lawyer.

  - item: And finally, speaking of the Speaker of the House, today Nancy Pelosi held a meeting with House Democrats to discuss the possibility of holding a vote on the impeachment inquiry--the lack of which is the basis of Republican criticisms of legitimacy. But in a press conference happening literally as I write this update, Pelosi and Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff said that they would not hold a vote yet.

  tomorrow: There's more testimony and more document deadlines to come. Tomorrow, arrested Giuliani aides Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman are supposed to supply documents to the House, while Thursday is the deadline for the White House to produce documents. Don't place any big money bets on those coming through. Also tomorrow, Michael McKinley, senior advisor to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who abruptly resigned last week, is set to testify. And Thursday, Gordon Sondland, US ambassador to the EU who was blocked from testifying by the White House last week, is scheduled to appear in the House. Folks, it's going to get more nuts. Sorry. 
- date: 2019-10-14
  yesterday: The last week of the impeachment inquiry was a wild one, with the White House <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/08/white-house-formally-tells-democrats-it-wont-cooperate-with-impeachment-probe-000279">calling the inquiry "illegitimate"</a> and refusing to take part, while Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer whose actions in Ukraine are at the center of the inquiry, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/two-foreign-born-men-who-helped-giuliani-on-ukraine-arrested-on-campaign-finance-charges-11570714188?mod=hp_lead_pos1">saw associates arrested on charges related to work in Ukraine</a>. It was a lot. Honestly, this week may be even more. Anyway, welcome to week four of the impeachment inquiry! We'll get through this together.
  todays: 
  - item: Today President Trump's former top advisor on Russia and Europe, Fiona Hill, gave testimony behind closed doors to House committees. Hill, who resigned her position at the National Security Council this summer, was expected to testify "that she and other officials objected strenuously to the removal of the ambassador to Ukraine, only to be disregarded" as well as be questioned about Rudy Giuliani's presence in Ukraine. Hill was the first person from the White House to give a deposition since the White House's letter last week refusing to cooperate with the investigation, and it does not appear that they attempted to block her testimony. She had no opening statement and no part of her testimony has yet to leak or be released, so we're just gonna have to be patient here.

    url: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/14/us/politics/who-is-fiona-hill.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage
  - item: Hill's testimony was not without some fireworks however, as Rep Matt Gaetz, who last week declared that House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff was the "Captain Kangaroo" of a "kangaroo court" (<i>stares into the camera</i>), arrived at Hill's deposition despite not being on the investigative committees and refused to leave until a House parliamentarian ruled he had to get out. "It's not like I'm on the Agriculture Committee," he told reporters. It's true, he's not.

  - item: The ability to keep testimony and witnesses private is at the center of ongoing concerns around the whistleblower's potential testimony. Yesterday Adam Schiff told CBS news that he was considering the possibility of not having the whistleblower testify because of growing worry that their identity would be leaked. "Our primary interest right now is making sure that that person is protected," he explained.

  - item: After reports about Schiff's concern for the whisteblower's safety surfaced, President Trump took to Twitter this morning to demand that the whistleblower be identified. "We must determine the Whistleblower’s identity to determine WHY this was done to the USA," the President tweeted. Please note that the Whistleblower Protection Act explicitly exists for this reason. Anyway, later he tweeted that people should watch Dancing with the Stars, so here we are.

  tomorrow: Today's testimony is just the tip of the iceberg for the week. In addition to a slew of deadlines (many of which are <i>tomorrow</i>) for documents by the White House, Rudy Giuliani, his arrested associates and others, there will also be testimony by numerous State Department officials, including US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland who last week was blocked from testifying by the White House. Hold on to your butts. 
- date: 2019-10-13
  yesterday: Week three of the impeachment inquiry was a real roller coaster, starting with the White House <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/10/08/768200323/trump-administration-blocks-ambassadors-testimony-a-key-witness-in-ukraine-scand">blocking the testimony</a> of the US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland and issuing a letter calling the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/08/white-house-formally-tells-democrats-it-wont-cooperate-with-impeachment-probe-000279">entire inquiry "illegitimate"</a> and ending with associates of the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/two-foreign-born-men-who-helped-giuliani-on-ukraine-arrested-on-campaign-finance-charges-11570714188?mod=hp_lead_pos1">arrested on federal charges</a> relating to work in Ukraine. Plus, a whole lot else. It was quite a week. Thank goodness nothing happens on the weekend. Oh, wait.
  todays: 
  - item: Late Friday, news broke that Rudy Giuliani is under federal investigation. Considering that two associates of his were  arrested last week and that Giuliani's dealings in Ukraine are swirling at the center of the impeachment inquiry, it's perhaps not that surprising. But still, as the New York Times points out, "it is also a stark turn for Mr Giuliani, who now finds himself under scrutiny from the same United States attorney’s office he led in the 1980s."
    source: New York Times
    url: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/us/politics/rudy-giuliani-investigation.html#click=https://t.co/dopfmfAZdr
  - item: The no-good-very-bad news week for Rudy Giuliani seemed to come to an ignoble end Friday when Trump said he "didn't know" if Giuliani was still his lawyer, but Trump sent out a series of encouraging tweets en route to his golf course Saturday morning, where he met Giuliani for lunch. So I guess that answers that, for now at least. 
    source: New York Times
    url: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/us/politics/trump-giuliani-lunch.html
  - item: Meanwhile, the week ended with a new understanding of the White House's letter that called the impeachment inquiry "illegitimate." While the letter was signed by White House counsel Pat Cipollone, a new report suggests that the letter was largely written by President Trump. According to the Daily Beast, "sources said that Trump enthusiastically suggested adding various jabs at Democratic lawmakers and would request that their 'unfair' treatment of him be incorporated into the letter." Sure, why not.
    source: Daily Beast
    url: https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-favorite-impeachment-lawyer-is-trump-himself
  - item: And, finally, in another "but wait, there's more" from last week, the same day that the White House letter dropped, US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland was blocked from testifying. As the week ended, his lawyers said that his testimony was back on and now, according to the Washington Post, he's going to testify that his text saying that there was "no quid pro quo" with Ukraine was also written under the president's direction. "It’s only true that the president said it, not that it was the truth," he's planning to explain. Help.

  tomorrow: The theme of the coming week is "deadlines." October 15 is the deadline for documents to be produced by Rudy Giuliani, VP Pence, the Office of Budget and Management, and the Department of Defense and the White House has a deadline to produce documents by October 18. Plus, Sondland is scheduled to testify on Thursday. I'm sure this will all go exactly as planned. 
- date: 2019-10-11
  yesterday: Week three of the impeachment inquiry kicked up more than a few notches this week. First, the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/08/white-house-formally-tells-democrats-it-wont-cooperate-with-impeachment-probe-000279">White House declared</a> the inquiry "illegitimate" and refused to cooperate. And then, associates of the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/two-foreign-born-men-who-helped-giuliani-on-ukraine-arrested-on-campaign-finance-charges-11570714188?mod=hp_lead_pos1">were arrested at a DC airport</a> with one-way tickets out of the country and charged with campaign finance violations in connection with work in Ukraine. Which, you know, seems like something. Anyway, that brings us to now...
  todays: 
  - item: Former US Ambassador to Ukraine Maria Yovanovitch testified behind closed doors to House committees today. Yovanovitch--who was called "bad news" by the president on his July phone call with Ukrainian president Zelensky and who was named as a target by the associates of Rudy Giuliani who were arrested yesterday--testified that "she was forced to leave Kiev on 'the next plane' this spring" on the president's orders. Furthermore, "she warned that private influence and personal gain have usurped diplomats' judgment, threatening to undermine the nation’s interests and drive talented professionals out of public service." Which definitely doesn't seem optimal for, you know, diplomacy.  
    source: New York Times
    url: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/us/politics/marie-yovanovitch-trump-impeachment.html
  - item: While Yovanovitch's testimony was not public, her opening statement for the deposition was leaked to multiple press outlets. In it, she warns that the State Department has been "attacked and hollowed out from within" and that "harm will come when private interests circumvent professional diplomats for their own gain, not the public good." It's worth reading the whole statement.

  - item: Yonanovitch's statement echoes reports from NBC last night that Fiona Hill, Trump's former top aide to Russia and Europe, is planning on testifying to Congress that "Rudy Giuliani and EU ambassador Gordon Sondland circumvented the National Security Council and the normal White House process to pursue a shadow policy on Ukraine."

  - item: Speaking of Gordon Sondland, who kicked off the week's excitement when he was blocked from testifying to the House by the president, his lawyers told NBC today that he will in fact testify next Thursday. However, texts and other documents requested won't accompany him because "by federal law and regulation, the State Department has sole authority to produce such documents." Yeah, don't place any bets on that happening.

  - item: And then there's Rudy Giuliani. We've learned a lot more today about his involvement with Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were arrested at Dulles Airport yesterday by federal authorities before they left the country. Specifically, it turns out that Giuliani was paid "hundreds of thousands of dollars" by Parnas for "business and legal advice" for Parnas's company--impossibly named "Fraud Guarantee"--at the same time that Parnas and Fruman were investigating in the Ukraine on Giuliani's behalf. Look, it's confusing. Parnas and Fruman have now been subpoenad by the House, maybe they can sort it out. 
    source: New York Times
    url: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/us/politics/rudy-giuliani-ukraine-associates.html
  - item: It seems like this Giuliani-associates story is only going to get more confusing, as a third person named in the indictment along with with Parnas and Fruman, a Ukrainian-born businessman named Andrey Kukushkin, was arrested in San Francisco earlier today. A fourth person named, David Correia, is still at large. What even am I writing.

  - item: And finally, because of course the week was going to wrap up this way, Donald Trump was asked by reporters on his way to a rally tonight if Rudy Giuliani was still his lawyer. His response? "I don't know." Sure, let's go with that.

  yesterday: Week three of the impeachment inquiry, which started with a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/08/white-house-formally-tells-democrats-it-wont-cooperate-with-impeachment-probe-000279">series of provocations</a> by the White House, took a breather on Wednesday. Beyond a <a href="https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/10819-0">milquetoast letter</a> from Nancy Pelosi and some <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry-live-updates/2019/10/09/d1bb38e0-e9f7-11e9-9c6d-436a0df4f31d_story.html">words of warning</a> from former VP Joe Biden, it was an actual chill day. Which definitely didn't start a trend if you were wondering. 
  todays: 
  - item: Some days are like yesterday, where very little happened. And some days are like today where the morning starts with news that two associates of Rudy Giuliani were arrested at the airport with one-way tickets out of the country. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who on Monday refused to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry, were arrested by federal agents at Dulles Airport late Wednesday. Manhattan US Attorney Geoffrey Berman says the two "sought political influence not only to advance their own financial interests but to advance the political interests of at least one foreign official--a Ukrainian government official who sought the dismissal of the US ambassador to Ukraine." The two had lunch with Rudy Giuliani at Trump's Washington DC hotel earlier that day, because sure why not.

  - item: Parans and Fruman were the subject of a prescient BuzzFeed story back in July that outlined the work they were doing for Rudy Giuliani in Ukraine and is well worth a read-over in light of today's news. 
    source: BuzzFeed
    url: https://www.buzzfeednews.com/amphtml/mikesallah/rudy-giuliani-ukraine-trump-parnas-fruman?__twitter_impression=true
  - item: Before departing for a rally Thursday night in Minneapolis, Trump took questions on the White House lawn and, as you might expect, denied knowing Parans and Fruman. "I don't know them, I don't know about them, I don't know what they do," he yelled. "You'll have to ask Rudy, I just don't know." 
    source: Associated Press
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDb8vaDDijs
  - item: Meanwhile Democrats in the House subpoenad Energy Secretary Rick Perry for documents about his involvement with Trump and Ukraine. Cited in the subpoena is the Axios story from this weekend that reported Trump told House Republicans that he only called Ukraine in July at the urging of Rick Perry, so it's not like nobody saw this subpoena coming or anything. "Your failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena," reads the accompanying letter, "including at the direction or behest of the President or the White House, shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House's impeachment inquiry and may be used as an adverse inference against you and the President." But, you know, we'll see.

  - item: And finally, tomorrow brings ousted US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch to the House for a deposition. Yovanovitch is called "bad news" in the call Trump had with Ukrainian president Zelensky in July. After saying that she was removed as ambassador, Trump went on to say "she's going to go through some things." Maybe by "some things" he meant testifying to the House on an impeachment inquiry? Anyway, we'll see if she doesn't get blocked last minute like Tuesday's expected testimony by Ambassador Sondland.

  tomorrow: Well, certainly the question of whether or not Yovanovitch will show up tomorrow is question one. And I'd expect we hear more fully from Democrats about the White House's refusal to cooperate--though I've been waiting for that all week. After that, it's Friday, so expect it definitely to be just super duper chill. Knock off early.
- date: 2019-10-09
  yesterday: Week three of the impeachment inquiry blew up on Tuesday. The day opened with the White House <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/10/08/768200323/trump-administration-blocks-ambassadors-testimony-a-key-witness-in-ukraine-scand">blocking the testimony of ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland</a> and it ended <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/08/white-house-formally-tells-democrats-it-wont-cooperate-with-impeachment-probe-000279">with a letter from the White House</a> that accused the impeachment inquiry of being "illegitimate" and refused to comply with it. That's one way to end a Tuesday. 
  todays: 
  - item: The Democratic response to the White House's refusal to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry was surprisingly subdued today. Nancy Pelosi issued a mild statement that was short on both rhetoric and specifics. "Mr. President, you are not above the law," she wrote this morning. "You will be held accountable." However, the letter failed to explain what that accountability would be or when it would happen. 
    source: original document
    url: https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/10819-0
  - item: In fact, the strongest Democratic voice for impeachment today came not from the House but from Joe Biden. "President Trump has indicted himself by obstructing justice, refusing to comply with a congressional inquiry," he told reporters. "He’s already convicted himself.” Which would be nice if that's how it worked, but it actually isn't--someone has to convict him. 
    source: Washington Post
    url: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry-live-updates/2019/10/09/d1bb38e0-e9f7-11e9-9c6d-436a0df4f31d_story.html
  - item: The question Biden poses--whether Trump's refusal to comply with the inquiry is itself an impeachable offense that should be pursued--is apparently the source of an internal debate among House Democrats. While most seem to agree that the letter represents a clear case of obstruction of Congress, "Democrats say they prefer any obstruction charge to play a supporting, rather than starring, role in their efforts." Cool cool.
    source: Politico
    url: https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/09/trump-impeachment-obstruction-democrats-043564
  tomorrow: Today was quiet. Almost too quiet. Certainly there's a bigger shoe to drop on the White House's refusal to cooperate. For subpoenas to mean something they have to be enforcable. Today didn't see that enforcement happen--or even an idea of how Democrats would--will tomorrow?

  yesterday: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/07/us/politics/trump-impeachment-ukraine.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage">Legal wranglings</a> have continued at pace with Trump's <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1181033360241709056">threats to "impeach" other lawmakers</a>. Really, that was Monday. It was a lot. This is the week that the impeachment proceedings really hit high gear and the best way to demonstrate that is not by looking back but looking forward...
  todays: 
  - item: Today feels like a series of escalating dares, culminating with a letter sent from the White House late this afternoon questioning the legitimacy of the entire impeachment inquiry and refusing to participate. "Given that your inquiry lacks any legitimate constitutional foundation, any pretense of fairness, or even the most elementary due process protections," writes White House lawyer Pat Cipollone, "the executive branch cannot be expected to participate in it." Which may not really be a thing, but as you can see from how the rest of the day played out below, it's the strategy they're going to go with. For now.

  - item: This letter topped off a day of back-and-forths that centered around the sudden blocking of the testimony of the ambassardor the EU, Gordon Sondland, by (ostensibly) the State Department. "Ambassador Sondland had previously agreed to appear voluntarily today, without the need for a subpoena," wrote his lawyers, "in order to answer the Committee's questions on an expedited basis. As the sitting U.S. Ambassador to the EU and employee of the State Department, Ambassador Sondland is required to follow the Department's direction." OK, but...

    url: https://www.npr.org/2019/10/08/768200323/trump-administration-blocks-ambassadors-testimony-a-key-witness-in-ukraine-scand
  - item: Of course it didn't take long for Trump to take to Twitter and explain that he, in fact, blocked the testimony, rationalizing that Sondland "would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican's rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public." Sure, why not. Oh, also--keep "kangaroo court" in mind because we're going to circle back to that in a couple bullet points. 
    source: Twitter
    url: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1181560708808486914
  - item: As you might expect by this point, Trump's tweet and the blocked testimony took House Republicans by surprise and a contingent of House Republicans went to the White House not because they were upset that the executive branch had interfered in legislative branch biz, but to try and get on the same page. According to Bloomberg, "White House officials agreed to improve communication of their impeachment strategy with allies who are on the front lines." Don't make any bets.

  tomorrow: Well, by every measure it seems like the long-promised "all hell breaks loose" is definitely on offer. But the main thing is it seems like it's very much up to the Democrats now for how they are going to proceed with enforcing subpoenas.

  yesterday: Welcome to week three of the impeachment inquiry, it's all going to go great right? Previously, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/controversial-phone-call-impeachment-calls-trump-whistleblower-timeline/story?id=65810201">a whistleblower report</a> of a phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky lead to House Democrats starting an impeachment inquiry. <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/documents/2019-10-04.EEC%20Engel%20Schiff%20to%20Mulvaney-WH%20re%20Subpoena.pdf">Legal wrangling</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/02/trump-says-democrats-wasting-time-on-bullshit-as-impeachment-probe-intensifies.html">name calling</a> followed (will let you guess who did what), <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/_cache/files/5/0/50759349-fe81-4444-a990-65c92528de82/50EE8A2F1CFC493A98876200762152FC.chairmen-letter-on-state-departmnent-texts-10-03-19.pdf">text messages</a> that backed up the basics of the inquiry were released, a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/2nd-whistleblower-forward-speaking-ig-attorney/story?id=66092396&cid=social_twitter_tw">second whistleblower stepped forward</a>, and well, here we are. 
  todays: 
  - item: More subpoenas went out from the House Intelligence Committee today, this time to the White House Budget office and the Pentagon. While previous subpoenas have been focused on Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky, these are focused on the motivations behind suspending $391 million in aid to Ukraine this summer--and whether the two are related. In other words, if this whole Ukrainian situation is a quid-pro-quo, today they're looking into the quid while previously they've been looking into the quo. Or maybe, I don't know--I don't speak Latin.

  - item: While subpoenas are going out and depositions are being scheduled, the House is also preparing for the testimony of the original whistleblower (a second was reported to have come forward this weekend). Concerned that their identity could be leaked by Republicans in traditional closed-door testimony, House Democrats are "considering testimony at a remote location and possibly obscuring the individual’s appearance and voice." Seems chill.

  - item: However, just because the House sends a request for testimony does not necessarily mean that person will show up. Today, two South Florida associates of Rudy Giuliani, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, announced through their lawyer (in a letter maddeningly set in Comic Sans) that they had "no response planned." According to the Miami Herald, "Democrats working on the burgeoning impeachment inquiry said Parnas and Fruman’s decision to ignore a request issued last Monday will lead to subpoenas, which would compel them to testify and provide documents or face criminal charges."

  - item: "And finally, while over the weekend Trump was threatening to impeach Mitt Romney (note: he can't), today he took to Twitter to say that Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff should be impeached for 'High Crimes and Misdemeanors, and even Treason' (note: he can't do that either). So things are going great."

  tomorrow: The second whistleblower certainly feels like the cloud hovering over this week for sure. Plus, there are a lot of subpoenas out there right now and we should soon see what the Democrats have planned for actually enforcing them. And also, it's Monday--we've got a whole lot of week left for things to go sideways.
- date: 2019-10-06
  yesterday: Week two of the impeachment inquiry was largely characterized by <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/documents/2019-10-04.EEC%20Engel%20Schiff%20to%20Mulvaney-WH%20re%20Subpoena.pdf">legal maneuvering</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/10/04/767205170/trump-demands-full-house-vote-on-impeachment-before-complying-with-lawmakers">dueling press statements</a> between House Democrats and the Trump administration. It came to a dramatic(ish) conclusion(ish) with the <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/_cache/files/5/0/50759349-fe81-4444-a990-65c92528de82/50EE8A2F1CFC493A98876200762152FC.chairmen-letter-on-state-departmnent-texts-10-03-19.pdf">release of text messages</a> between State Department officials that largely lined up with and fleshed out the original whistleblower's complaint that Trump was connecting military aide to Ukraine with investigating political rivals. That set up a weekend so chill that I completely upended my "no weekends" publishing plan. Welcome to Sunday. 
  todays: 
  - item: A second whistleblower has come forward! Reported Sunday morning by ABC News, this whistleblower, described only as an "intelligence official," has "first-hand knowledge of some of the allegations outlined in the original complaint." This second whistleblower has already spoken with Michael Atkinson, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community. First-hand knowledge would complicate the inaccurate Republican talking point that the first whistleblower was only reporting "hearsay."

  - item: Speaking of things that aren't hearsay, Republican Senator from Wisconsin Ron Johnson told the Wall Street Journal that the US Ambassador to the European Union explained to him back in August that US military aide to Ukraine was tied to investigating the 2016 election. "At that suggestion, I winced," Johnson told the Journal. "My reaction was, 'Oh, God. I don’t want to see those two things combined.'" Trump, naturally, denied that they were. But between the whistleblower, the State Department texts, Senator Johnson, and now a second whistleblower there's a lot of corroboration of this "hearsay."

  - item: Meanwhile Trump spent most of his Saturday at his Virginia golf club angry about Utah Senator Mitt Romney, who has offered some mild criticism of the Ukraine phone call and Trump's similar request for China to investigate Joe Biden. Trump seems to have decided that "I'm rubber, you're glue" is a workable defense and has called for Romney's impeachment. Please note, you can't actually impeach a US Senator.

  - item: And finally, because why not, yesterday it came out that Trump told House Republicans that this whole Ukrainian phone call mess was actually the work of former Texas Governor, Dancing with the Stars entrant, and current Energy Secretary Rick Perry. Which must come as a surprise to pretty much everyone involved since his name only appears in passing in the original whistleblower report, he's not mentioned on the call transcript, nor is he named in the released text messages. But hey, let's go with it. Conveniently, Rick Perry announced he was leaving his post as Energy Secretary last week.

  tomorrow: We're rolling up on a solid *checks notes* two weeks of this impeachment inquiry and we already have multiple confirmations of the central point of the investigation. So surely this next week will be very straightforward, right? Right? Hello?

  yesterday: After a week of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/us/politics/impeachment-white-house-subpoena.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage">legal wrangling</a> by the Democrats and <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cnn-trump-bullshit-vulgarity_n_5d94dea1e4b0ac3cddb27d0e?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALXA_r29kaLfKOszR71iz8XBQhQluFvati-BG3gNQ5Bqve8H19kTTrOSBZ4zuJpKpj3bHKFg9mTPHYd5YLtyLi27XQjwojbFiSXicwsZOYovBWZtZhdDzujp9pq8nb8aMhgcAbHU17o7aA-U6m-I4naHA25XDthdcUSQmW3zN-AM">explosive statements</a> to the press by the president, yesterday ended with the <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/_cache/files/5/0/50759349-fe81-4444-a990-65c92528de82/50EE8A2F1CFC493A98876200762152FC.chairmen-letter-on-state-departmnent-texts-10-03-19.pdf">evening release of text messages</a> between various State Department officials that largely corroborated the whistleblower's original complaint that the president was withholding military aid from Ukraine in order to pressure them to investigate Joe Biden. It was quite a way to (almost) wrap the week. Which brings us to...
  todays: 
  - item: Low-key looming over today has been the end of the deadline set by Elijah Cummings, chair of the House Oversight Committee, for the White House to turn over documents related to the Ukrainian phone call or face a subpoena to do the same. Well, guess what? The White House didn't comply, and so just as this update was being drafted, a subpoena was sent to White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. The White House now has until October 18 to comply. "Your failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena," the accompanying letter reads, "including at the direction or behest of the President or others at the White House, shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House's impeachment inquiry and may be used as an adverse inference against you and the President."

  - item: According to a report by Axios, the White House is readying a response "arguing that President Trump and his team can ignore lawmakers' demands until [Pelosi] holds a full House vote formally approving an impeachment inquiry." Which doesn't seem to have a lot of legal standing, but here we are.

  - item: Meanwhile, if you've been wondering whatever happened to Vice President Pence, who seems to have gone missing, last night the Washington Post broke a story that Trump "repeatedly involved Vice President Pence in efforts to exert pressure on the leader of Ukraine at a time when the president was using other channels to solicit information that he hoped would be damaging to a Democratic rival." Sources close to Pence say he was "unaware" of Trump's motivations to get information on Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Which, OK sure.

  - item: And, citing in part the Washington Post's report, today House investigators sent a letter to the Vice President requesting a sprawling list of documents related to actions involving Ukraine. It's not a subpoena, yet, but Pence's deadline is October 15.

  tomorrow: It's the weekend, surely nothing will happen, right? But next week, expect extensive fireworks surrounding these latest subpoenas and document requests. This weekend though, let's all just hit the sauna or something.
- date: 2019-10-03
  yesterday: This week's impeachment news has been largely defined by <a href="ttps://www.cnn.com/2019/09/27/politics/pompeo-congressional-subpoena-ukraine/index.html">legal wrangling</a> and issuing statements to the press by both <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cnn-trump-bullshit-vulgarity_n_5d94dea1e4b0ac3cddb27d0e?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALXA_r29kaLfKOszR71iz8XBQhQluFvati-BG3gNQ5Bqve8H19kTTrOSBZ4zuJpKpj3bHKFg9mTPHYd5YLtyLi27XQjwojbFiSXicwsZOYovBWZtZhdDzujp9pq8nb8aMhgcAbHU17o7aA-U6m-I4naHA25XDthdcUSQmW3zN-AM">the President</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fooling-house-democrat-leading-impeachment-probe/story?id=66004383">the Democrats</a>. The presidents statements have been <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/02/politics/president-donald-trump-impeachment-democrats-pompeo/index.html">far more inflamatory</a>, and the Democrats have been firing back with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/us/politics/impeachment-white-house-subpoena.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage">legal threats</a>. It's been a long week. 
  todays:
  - item: LATE UPDATE—Late Thursday night, the three chairs of the House Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs committees released a series of texts they obtained from former US Special Envoy to the Ukraine Kurt Volker. In the letter that accompanies the release they write that these texts reflect concerns that "critical military assistance and the meeting between the two presidents were being withheld in order to place additional pressure on Ukraine to deliver on the President's demand for Ukraine to launch politically motivated investigations." They are truly wild and include conversations between State Department officials that largely corroborate and add further context to the whistleblower's report. As Bill Taylor, the Charge d'Affaires (the acting ambassador, essentially) at the US Embassy in Ukraine asks in one of the texts, "Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?" Yes, yes we are.

  - item: Some days you try hard to come up with a lead story and some days Donald Trump stands on the White House lawn and asks Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. And then ask China to do it too.  Ukraine "should investigate the Bidens," he said to reporters on live TV, "because how does a company that's newly formed—and all these companies—and by the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine." This really happened.

  - item: Meanwhile, the Democrat's impeachment inquiry that centers on whether Trump asked the Ukraine to investigate a political rival continued, despite the fact that he did so live on television moments before. Today saw former US Special Envoy to the Ukraine Kurt Volker testify that he "warned President Trump’s personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, that Giuliani was receiving untrustworthy information from Ukrainian political figures about former vice president Joe Biden and his son." Volker resigned his position last week after being implicated in the whistleblower report.

  - item: Speaking of Volker, the Guardian has an excellent look into how this "mild-mannered former ambassador to Nato" ended up enmeshed in this whole fiaso. The short of it?

  tomorrow: Tomorrow is Elijah Cummings deadline for White House cooperation to turn over documents or he's subpoenaing them, so that should be interesting. Also, it's Friday tomorrow, I'm sure it will be chill. TGIF right? 
- date: 2019-10-02
  yesterday: The second week of the impeachment inquiry has moved rapidly into a legal maneuvering stage, with Democrats issuing subpoenas to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/27/politics/pompeo-congressional-subpoena-ukraine/index.html">Secretary of State Mike Pompeo</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/us/politics/impeach-giuliani-subpoena.html">Rudy Giuliani</a> and those same folks <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/01/mike-pompeo-trump-impeachment-inquiry-democrats-ukraine">pushing back</a> against complying. Tensions, already high, are getting higher, with the president repeatedly calling the impeachment inquiry <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1178643854737772545">treasonous</a>. It's been a week, and it's only Wednesday.
  todays: 
  - item: Wednesday opened with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo telling reporters traveling with him in Rome that he was listening in on the call between Trump and Ukrainian president Zelensky--he had not previously revealed his presence on the call. "Asked if the call raised any red flags in his mind, Pompeo did not respond."

  - item: Later in the morning, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi held her weekly press conference where she was joined by Chair of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff. At the presser, Schiff said that if the President or the administration interferes in the impeachment inquiry, "any action like that that forces us to litigate or have to consider litigation will be considered further evidence of obstruction of justice."

  - item: Then Trump held a wild press conference with the president of Finland where he once again called for Schiff to be "looked into for treason" and claimed that Schiff wrote the whistleblower report himself. And then it <i>really</i> went off the rails, ending with Trump screaming at Fox News reporter John Roberts to ask a question to the Finnish president instead of continually pressing him about the Ukraine call.
    source: CNN
    url: https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/02/politics/president-donald-trump-impeachment-democrats-pompeo/index.html
  - item: Finally, the New York Times offered a revealing look at the early days of the whistleblower complaint, including the detail that the whistleblower, following correct procedure, approached an aide at the House Intelligence Committee about their complaint after they felt it wasn't moving forward at the CIA. "The House staff member, following the committee’s procedures, suggested the officer find a lawyer to advise him and meet with an inspector general, with whom he could file a whistle-blower complaint." This is already being mischaracterized by the president as direct involvement by Schiff in the complaint.

Subpoenas have gone out to both <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-issue-subpoena-pompeos-ukraine-documents/story?id=65912440">Secretary of State Mike Pompeo</a> and the president's <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-issue-subpoena-pompeos-ukraine-documents/story?id=65912440">personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani</a>, who seems to be at the center of much of the Ukraine intrigue. 
  todays: 
  - item: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took to Twitter this morning to say that the Democrats were attempting to "intimidate, bully, & treat improperly the distinguished professionals of the Department of State" by asking for five current and former officials to testify.
