  yesterday: Yesterday we learned what happens next in the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump&#58; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-26/house-to-open-next-trump-impeachment-phase-with-dec-4-hearing?srnd=premium">it moves to the House Judiciary Committee</a>, which will hold its first public hearing on December 4th. Additionally this week, White House lawyers have been fighting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/27/us/politics/trump-legal-strategy.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage">multiple judicial decisions</a> against their assertion that administration officials have "absolute immunity" over congressional subpoenas, which is definitely when you know it's going well. Anyway, for being a short week before a national holiday and long weekend, it's been surprisingly busy.
  todays: 
  - item: <b>With yesterday's announcement that the impeachment inquiry is moving to its next phase after the Thanksgiving recess, the White House is left with a choice&#58; to cooperate or not.</b> This phase of the process, which moves to the House Judiciary Committee, is focused on evaluating evidence and drafting articles of impeachment. A major difference from the first phase of the inquiry is that it includes the opportunity for the administration to participate, including cross-examining witnesses and presenting a defense. Despite the oft-repeated talking points about being denied due process and not being able to defend themselves, now that the door is open, it's reported that the White House <i>still</i> may not take part. Shocking, I know. According to the New York Times, those involved in the decision "are deeply suspicious of taking part in a process they view as unfair." Of course, one way to make the process fairer would be to engage with it, but <i>shruggie emoji</i>. The White House has until 6pm Sunday to decide.

  - item: Meanwhile, today we learned more from yesterday's release of the testimony of Mark Sandy, deputy associate director for national security programs at the Office of Management and Budget. According to his deposition, which was performed behind closed doors last month, <b>Sandy told investigators that "two officials at the White House budget office resigned this year partly because of their concerns about President Trump’s decision to hold up congressionally approved security assistance to Ukraine."</b> The hold on aid to Ukraine is a central part of the impeachment inquiry and while so far investigators have not directly connected the hold with the president's demand that Ukraine investigate his political rivals, they have also not been able to uncover any <i>actual</i> reason why the aid was being withheld. That people within the White House's own budget office were quitting over it certainly underscores just how irregular the hold was.

  - item: Speaking of irregular, the Washington Post is reporting that <b>Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer whose machinations in Ukraine on behalf of the president are a central part of the impeachment investigation, may have been negotiating a contract to represent Ukrainian prosecutor Yuri Lutsenko for $200,000 at the same time he was working with Lutsenko to dig up information on whether Joe Biden used Ukrainian connections for personal gain</b>. Which, <i>waves hands in all directions</i>. While it appears that money never exchanged hands, "negotiations proceeded far enough that legal agreements were drafted under which Giuliani’s company would have received more than $200,000 to work for the Ukrainians," the Post reported. Sure, why not.

  - item: This latest revelation about Giuliani comes after a week where his partner Lev Parnas announced he had shared documents with the impeachment inquiry, and reports came out that federal investigators were issuing subpoenas into Giuliani's business dealings. It was not a great week for Rudy. Which might explain why <b>President Trump told conservative pundit Bill O'Reilly that he "didn't direct" Rudy to go to Ukraine.</b> <i>Stares</i>. When asked by O'Reilly what Giuliani was doing in Ukraine then, Trump replied that "you'd have to ask that to Rudy" and that "Rudy has other clients, other than me." While Trump didn't explicitly disavow Giuliani—he told O'Reilly that Rudy was "a warrior"—it's a very curious turn by the president considering there have been two weeks of public testimony directly connecting him with Giuliani's actions in Ukraine. But sure, let's go with he was freelancing. <i>Why not?</i>

Even before that, the report being compiled by House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff should be completed and we should learn whether the White House will participate in this next phase (don't hold your breath on that one).

  yesterday: The first public phase of the impeachment inquiry came to a close last week after <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/11/22/everything-new-we-learned-since-start-public-testimony-impeachment-inquiry/">two weeks of testimony by a dozen witnesses</a>. Yesterday, House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/25/politics/adam-schiff-letter-impeachment-timeline/">announced that the committee was compiling a report</a> containing the evidence gathered thus far and would be turning it over to the Judiciary Committee for the start of the next phase. Today, we learned when that would begin. 
  todays: 
  - item: The next phase of the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump now has a start date&#58; December 4. <b>With the conclusion of hearings by the Intelligence Committee, impeachment work now moves to the House Judiciary Committee, which will start open hearings next Wednesday.</b> <i>That's really soon.</i> This new phase will be different than the public hearings that just ended, as the Judicial Committee is charged with deciding articles of impeachment, not on investigation. Another big change from last time is that the president will be able to have counsel cross examine witnesses. "The president has a choice to make," Judicial Committee chair Jerry Nadler said today, "he can take this opportunity to be represented in the impeachment hearings, or he can stop complaining about the process." One of the president's regular complaints is that he hasn't had representation in the hearings, so this fixes that, but the idea that he'll stop complaining about the process sounds far less likely. Either way, December 4, save the date!

  - item: The announcement of new hearings is great because just <b>earlier today President Trump went on Twitter to say that he would "love  to have Mike Pompeo, Rick Perry, Mick Mulvaney and many others testify"</b> and now, with new hearings announced, most certainly they can, <i>right?</i> I mean, sure, any of those people could have easily testified the <i>many</i> times they were asked to by congressional investigators before now. And, you know, if the president was making a <i>truly</i> genuine offer, maybe there wouldn't have been administration lawyers spending their pre-holiday days in court fighting against congressional subpoenas on multiple fronts. But sure, you know, the president said it so, <i>stares off into the middle distance</i>.

  - item: Meanwhile, back in this reality, administration lawyers spent their pre-holiday days in court fighting against congressional subpoenas on multiple fronts. First, <b>lawyers from the Department of Justice have asked District Court Judge Kentanji Brown Jackson to put her ruling from yesterday—which found that the White House could not stop members of the administration from testifying to Congress—on hold so they can appeal it to the US District Court of Appeals</b>. In her ruling, Judge Jackson said that the administration argument of "absolute immunity" against congressional subpoenas was "baseless" and that "Presidents are not kings." If the ruling stands, former White House counsel Don McGahn would be compelled to testify and it could give the green light to other administration officials to follow suit as well. However, it will likely get tied up in appeals for some time because that's a pattern we've seen repeatedly at this point <i>including today in another case</i>, but please tell me again how much the president would "love" all his men to testify.

  - item: On the subject of that other case, administration lawyers yesterday got a stay on a <i>different</i> ruling that would have compelled the administration to abide by Congressional subpoena. <b>The US Supreme Court has put a temporary block on a ruling by the US District Court of Appeals that required the accounting firm that does the president's taxes to turn over tax records to congressional Democrats.</b> The stay is in place so that administration lawyers can file an appeal with the Supreme Court that they shouldn't have to release the tax documents to the House. The Supreme Court has given them until December 5th to file that appeal. Man, I could have sworn that the president just today said he would <i>love</i> for people to be—<i>oh forget it</i>.

  - item: One of the people Trump said he would "love" to have testify is former National Security Advisor John Bolton, but Bolton won't testify until a judge decides whether he should comply with congressional subpoena or follow the White House's order of non-compliance. Now, you'd think that yesterday's ruling by Judge Jackson, who declared that presidents "do not have subjects, bound by loyalty or blood, whose destiny they are entitled to control," would have decided that. But <b>today Bolton's lawyers said that Jackson's ruling didn't apply to Bolton because of the national security aspects of his job.</b> <i>Stares</i>. "Any passing references in the McGahn decision to presidential communications concerning national security matters are not authoritative," his lawyer said in a statement. As a result, Bolton is still waiting on judicial review, the first hearing for which is scheduled December 10th. <i>It's been 84 years dot gif</i>.

  - item: Finally, today the last two remaining transcripts from last month's closed-door depositions were released. The final two testimonies, by Philip Reeker, acting assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, and Mark Sandy, deputy associate director for national security programs at the Office of Management and Budget, offered a deeper look into the behind-the-scenes machinations happening at both the State Department and the Office of Budget and Management this summer. At the Budget Office, Sandy testified, nobody knew why $400M in aid to Ukraine had been put on hold, only "that the president is directing a hold" on it. And at the State Department, it struck Reeker as "irregular" that the US ambassador to the EU was involved in Ukraine affairs (Ukraine is not in the EU). But, he added "If that was the choice of the President and the Secretary, then obviously, that was their choice." It sure was.

  yesterday: Two weeks of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump wrapped up last week. Over the course of the hearings, a dozen witnesses testified about <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/11/22/everything-new-we-learned-since-start-public-testimony-impeachment-inquiry/">the circumstances surrounding interactions the president and other administration officials had with the new president of Ukraine</a> and the potential that those interactions included <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/gordon-sondland-accuses-president-bribery">attempting to pressure Ukraine into investigating the president's political rivals in return for a visit to the White House and the release of halted military aid</a>. While the hearings seemed to wrap last week, next steps were left unclear. That is, until today. 
  todays: 
  - item: House Intelligence Committee Chair <b>Adam Schiff put to rest any question of what happens next with the impeachment inquiry in a letter sent to House colleagues today, saying that a report summarizing the inquiry's findings is underway and will be sent to the House Judiciary Committee "soon after Congress returns from the Thanksgiving recess."</b> But wait, aren't there like—<i>waves hands in all directions</i>—things that could still be investigated? Well yes, and Schiff isn't writing that off&#58; "While we will continue with our investigative work and do not foreclose the possibility of further depositions or hearings," he writes, "we will not allow the President or others to drag this out for months on end in the courts." Besides, Schiff says, "the evidence of wrongdoing and misconduct by the President that we have gathered to date is clear and hardly in dispute. What is left to us now is to decide whether this behavior is compatible with the office of the Presidency, and whether the Constitutional process of impeachment is warranted." So with that, once they receive the report, the Judiciary Committee will consider the evidence and, most likely, draft articles of impeachment in the coming weeks. Here we go—again.

    url: https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/25/politics/adam-schiff-letter-impeachment-timeline/
  - item: Even while Schiff is drafting his report, a big ruling came down this evening about the administration's stance of "absolute immunity" against congressional subpoenas that could have big repercussions on the impeachment inquiry. The short version? <b>The White House's "claim to unreviewable absolute testimonial immunity" is "baseless, and as such, cannot be sustained."</b> The ruling, from Federal District Court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, comes on a case House Democrats have been pursuing since the Mueller investigation. While the original lawsuit was about compelling the testimony of then-White House counsel Don McGahn, Judge Jackson's ruling was much broader, stating that the law applied to "other current and former senior-level White House officials" as well. Judge Jackson's ruling could have massive implications on the current impeachment proceedings, considering that the White House has blocked many relevant witnesses from testifying, including Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, former National Security Advisor John Bolton, former Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and many others. Of course, this ruling is almost certainly going to be appealed to the Supreme Court so maybe Adam Schiff has a point about the White House dragging this out "for months on end in the courts." But at least on paper, it's a big win for the rule of law.

  - item: What's at stake in this lawsuit was underlined once again today in a <b>Washington Post report that an administration review of the president's decision to withhold aid from Ukraine has "turned up hundreds of documents that reveal extensive efforts to generate an after-the-fact justification for the decision and a debate over whether the delay was legal."</b> This internal review was undertaken because of the impeachment inquiry and White House lawyers are now "expressing concern that the review has turned up some unflattering exchanges and facts that could at a minimum embarrass the president." If only there was a way of legally requiring these documents be turned over to congressional investigators. <i>Thinking face emoji</i>.

  - item: Speaking of turning things over to congressional investigators, ABC News is reporting that <b>Lev Parnas, an associate of Rudy Giuliani's who was arrested last month in part over his work in Ukraine, has turned over photos, audio, and video to the House Intelligence Committee.</b> <i>Oh</i>.  Parnas's lawyer said that "his evidence and potential testimony is non-partisan, and not intended to be part of a battle between the left and the right, but rather an aid in the determination by our government of what is in the best interests of our nation." Which I mean OK, but <i>what is on those tapes?</i> For now, we don't know. 
    source: ABC News
    url: https://abcnews.go.com/amp/Politics/house-intelligence-committee-possession-video-audio-recordings-giuliani/story
  - item: Finally, the federal investigation into Parnas and his partner Igor Fruman is potentially moving on to a much larger target&#58; Rudy Giuliani. <b>According to the Wall Street Journal, recent subpoenas in the federal investigation that caught Parnas and Fruman "suggest that prosecutors are looking closely at the work of Mr. Giuliani himself."</b> The subpoenas, according to the Journal, cover an extensive list of potential charges&#58;  "obstruction of justice, money laundering, conspiracy to defraud the United States, making false statements to the federal government, serving as an agent of a foreign government without registering with the Justice Department, donating funds from foreign nationals, making contributions in the name of another person or allowing someone else to use one’s name to make a contribution, along with mail fraud and wire fraud." Giuliani, of course, denies any wrongdoing, saying, "There’s obviously a concerted effort to spread as many lies about me as possible, to destroy my reputation so that I’m not credible when I continue to reveal all of the massive evidence of criminality by the Bidens." Which, <i>screams</i>.

  yesterday: Public testimony in the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump may have wrapped up on Thursday with the testimony of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/us/politics/impeachment-hearing.html">Fiona Hill and David Holmes</a>. Over the last two weeks, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/11/22/everything-new-we-learned-since-start-public-testimony-impeachment-inquiry/">a dozen witnesses have testified</a> about extensive interactions with Ukraine over the spring and summer by both administration officials and people like Rudy Giuliani acting on behalf of the president and how those interactions lead to pressuring the Ukrainians to get them to investigate the President's political rivals. While it's not entirely clear what happens next (see the final bullet of today's update for more on that), what's happened up to now has been remarkable.
  todays: 
  - item: The weekend got off to a surprisingly impactful start with <b>the release of 100 pages of documents relevant to the impeachment investigation from the State Department on Friday night</b>. The documents, which were acquired via FOIA by the watchdog group American Oversight, show "multiple contacts" between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani this spring—exactly the time Giulaini was conducting a "smear campaign" against then-ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich. The documents, which were released by the State Department after a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by American Oversight, also include two conspiracy-heavy dossiers on Joe Biden's work in Ukraine enclosed in Trump Hotel folders that were addressed to Secretary of State Pompeo and were sent from the White House. So like, <i>brain actually explodes</i>.

  - item: Friday night continued to be a rough one for Giuliani, when CNN reported that a lawyer representing Giuliani associate Lev Parnas—who was arrested at Dulles Airport last month on charges stemming in part from his work in Ukraine—said that <b>his client was willing to tell Congress about meetings Rep Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, had with former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Victor Shokin last December in Vienna</b>. <i>Wait, what??</i> Parnas's lawyer, Joseph Bondy, went on to tell CNN that Parnas was "willing to comply with a Congressional subpoena for documents and testimony as part of the impeachment inquiry in a manner that would allow him to protect his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination." Which, <i>exploded brain explodes again</i>. Nunes has threatened to sue CNN over the allegations.

  - item: With Parnas allegedly connecting the dots between Nunes and the major players in the Ukraine scandal, <b>it appears that the House is moving toward an ethics investigation on Devin Nunes</b>. <i>Ya think?</i> When asked about a potential investigation, Rep Adam Smith, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said it was "quite likely, without question." The Washington Post also connected a Nunes aide with "a group that met frequently in spring 2019 at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, to discuss the Biden matter." That group, according to Parnas's lawyer, included Giulini, Parnas, Lev Fruman (who was arrested with Parnas last month), and two lawyers. I wonder if they used Trump hotel folders for their dossiers? <i>Even more brain explosions.</i>

  - item: How'd all this sit with Rudy? Well, <b>Giuliani went to Fox News on Saturday and said if the president were to throw him "under the bus" that "I have insurance."</b> If you were wondering what Giuliani meant by "insurance," he went on Twitter later in the day to clarify&#58; "The statement I’ve made several times of having an insurance policy, if thrown under bus, is sarcastic & relates to the files in my safe about the Biden Family’s 4 decade monetizing of his office." Which certainly seemed like maybe the most bonkers thing he could say until he added "If I disappear, it will appear immediately along with my RICO chart." <i>Brain exploding back and forth, forever.</i>

  - item: With this <i>impossibly</i> bananas weekend in the background, House Intelligence chair Adam Schiff went on CNN's State of the Union today to answer lingering questions on what happens next in the impeachment inquiry. The answer? It appears that he's taking a two-pronged approach&#58; taking all "the time that's necessary" to compile a report for the Judiciary Committee—which will be in charge of the next phase—but "we may have other depositions and hearings to do" in the Intelligence Committee because "we've continued to learn new information every day and I think that's going to continue." <i>Do you think so?</i> As a result, Schiff said, they may be making addendums and additions to any report they supply to the Judiciary Committee.

  tomorrow: Well it's Thanksgiving week, Congress is recessed, and the president heads to Mar a Lago on Tuesday, so expect things to be just very chill and cool.

  yesterday: This phase of the House impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump may (seriously, <i>we don't actually know</i>) have come to a close yesterday after two weeks of open testimony with the final two witnesses. But what witnesses they were! Fiona Hill, former senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council, explained about the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/us/politics/impeachment-hearing.html">"domestic political errand"</a> that the president sent US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland on, while David Holmes, a State Department official who works at the US Embassy in Ukraine, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/live-blog/nov-21-impeachment-hearings-live-updates-n1087686/ncrd1088436#liveBlogHeader">reenacted the phone call he overheard</a> between the president and Sondland. And then it was over (again&#58; ???) and the big question is, like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XdAQpq_1Xw">Buffy musical episode</a> asks, "where do we go from here?"
  todays: 
  - item: When Adam Schiff gaveled yesterday's Intelligence Committee to a close yesterday, he did so leaving questions unanswered&#58; Will more witnesses be called? Will they pursue administration officials who have defied subpoenas? Whatever happened to the president's offer to submit written testimony? Is this the end of this phase of impeachment hearings? Today didn't bring clarity to any of those questions, <b>but there are some indications that perhaps there are <i>new</i> questions emerging at the House Judiciary Committee who—if this really is the end of this phase—will be picking up the impeachment baton</b>. According to the Wall Street Journal, those questions include <i>tiny</i> details like "how the Judiciary Committee wants to handle hearings," which, like, you'd think they'd have thought of before now but who hasn't done an all-nighter before the big test right? Anyway, the Journal offers a potential timeline from here, that includes hearings and a vote in the Judiciary Committee the first two weeks of December, followed by floor debate over articles of impeachment that could "consume the entire week of December 15" and a vote "shortly before Christmas." <i>Ho ho nooooooo</i>.

  - item: Nature may abhor a vacuum, but the President of the United States loves one and moved quickly to fill the void left by the absence of impeachment hearings today. <b>President Trump gave a rambling, 53 minute interview on—where else—Fox & Friends this morning where he lashed out at many of the witnesses in the impeachment proceedings.</b> David Holmes' overheard phone call? "I guarantee you that never took place," Trump said (Gordon Sondland corroborated the call in his testimony). Gordon Sondland? "Hardly know him," Trump explained (Sondland donated a $1M to the Trump inaugural committee). Former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch? She said "bad things about me. She wouldn’t defend me." (<i>Stares</i>.)  He went on to say that he knows the identity of the whistleblower and continued to spread the now thoroughly-debunked theory that Ukraine "hated me. They were after me in the election." So, you know, it went real well.

  - item: Meanwhile, since we're on the messy-people-who-live-for-drama beat, <b>former national security advisor John Bolton returned to Twitter this morning</b>. Bolton, who has defied a subpoena to appear in the impeachment proceedings and who has been namechecked repeatedly in testimony the last two weeks, tweeted that he had "liberated the Twitter account, previously suppressed unfairly in the aftermath of my resignation as National Security Advisor." He ended two different tweets with "stay tuned........" and "More to come....."—you'd better believe I copy/pasted those periods <i>exactly</i>—so clearly there's going to be some mustachioed drama to come.

  yesterday: Open hearings in the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump hit high gear this week with <i>two</i> eleven-hour days of testimony. Over those 22 hours, we <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/impeachment-hearing-11-19-19">learned more</a> about the July 25 call President Trump had with Ukrainian president Zelensky and the fallout from it, as well as gained additional understanding about the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/20/laura-cooper-david-hale-impeachment-hearings-live-highlights-and-updates-072240">hold placed on military aid for Ukraine by the White House</a>. But the centerpiece of the week was the testimony of US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland, who didn't mince words yesterday when he asked, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/20/us/politics/gordon-sondland-opening-statement-ukraine.html">"Was there a 'quid pro quo'? And answered, "The answer is yes."</a> Which brings us to today.
  todays: 
  - item: Two weeks of public impeachment hearings wrapped today with <b>the testimony of Fiona Hill, former senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council, and David Holmes, a State Department official who works at the US Embassy in Ukraine</b>. After yesterday's lengthy, surprising testimony by US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland, I'll admit that I thought today was going to be a snooze. But it turned out to be some of the most compelling, clear, and crucial testimony of the last two weeks—every copyeditor just cringed at my use of three c's there. <i>Sorry not sorry.</i> A few highlights&#58; 
    source: 
    url:
  - item: The hearing opened with Fiona Hill taking apart the Republican theory—voiced over and over at these hearings—that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election. <b>"Some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country—and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did," she testified. "This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves."</b> Later, Hill expanded on the Russian's motivation&#58; "The goal of the Russians was really to put whoever was going to become the president … under a cloud." Whoever won, Hill explained, the Russians ultimately wanted to "pit one side of the electorate against the other. That they would pit one party against the other … That they would create just the kind of chaos that we have seen in our politics." <i>Sound familiar?</i>

  - item: David Holmes' testimony offered a first-hand account of the activity at the US embassy in Ukraine during the timeframe leading up to Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian president Zelensky, and the aftermath of that call. At the Embassy, Holmes testified, "we'd been hearing about the investigations"—into the Bidens and the 2016 election, pushed by Rudy Giulani—"since March." Giuliani's involvement, Holmes said, wasn't welcome by Ambassador Sondland, who told him "every time Rudy gets involved he goes and F's it all up." <b>But, according to Holmes, Sondland became a key conduit between Ukraine and the president on these investigations, leading to a phone call Sondland held with President Trump on the terrace of a restaurant in Kiev on July 26</b>, the day after the president's call with Ukrainian president Zelensky. Holmes, who reenacted the call with flair, said that when asked by the president if Zelensky would do "the investigations," Sondland replied "He will do it. He'll do anything you ask him to." On Twitter, the president questioned whether it was possible to overhear conversations on the phone, which, <i>screams</i>.

  - item: Sondland was a focus for Republican counsel Steve Castor who, it seemed, hoped to get Hill to cast Sondland's testimony yesterday into question. Instead, when Castor asked her what made her angry in a meeting she had with Sondland, she turned it around in stunning fashion&#58; "What I was angry about was that he wasn't coordinating with us. But I've actually realized, having listened to his deposition, that he was absolutely right. He wasn't coordinating with us because we weren't doing the same thing he was doing." So what <i>was</i> Sondland doing? "He said to me, I'm briefing the president, I'm briefing Chief of Staff Mulvaney, I'm briefing Secretary Pompeo, and I've talked with Ambassador Bolton. Who else do I have to deal with?" <b>It struck her, Hill said, as she looked at the emails Sondland supplied in yesterday's testimony, "that he was absolutely right. Because he was being involved in a domestic political errand and we were involved in national security foreign policy and those two things had just diverged.</b>" And <i>that</i>—more than almost anything else that's been said the last two weeks—is the whole problem.

  - item: While testimony continued at the House, <b>President Trump and Senate Republicans met at the White House to discuss strategy for what will likely become an impeachment trial in the Senate</b>. According to Politico, there's a feeling that "a motion to dismiss won't fly," and so instead Republicans, at the White House's prompting, "want some kind of factual affirmative defense on the merits." What kind of "merits" you ask? According to White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley, Trump "wants to be able to bring up witnesses like Adam Schiff, like the whistleblower, like Hunter Biden, like Joe Biden." <i>Disintegrates into a pile of ash; is blown away by a stiff fall breeze</i>.

  - item: But, back here in reality, <i>are</i> we headed to a trial in the Senate? Today's hearings wrapped without clear next steps given. <b>Congress takes a recess for Thanksgiving next week and, with no more hearings currently scheduled, what happens from here is a bit up in the air.</b> While I'd expect House Democrats to clarify what they're planning before going on break—and I'd be a little surprised if, coming out of Sondland's testimony yesterday, they don't attempt to call more witnesses—Bloomberg offers a useful look at the many options they have in front of them.

  tomorrow: Well, as I just said above, what's next is a little bit unknown. So probably what's coming next is clarity on that. And a lot of spin, maneuvering, and attempts at reframing narratives from Republicans and the White House. Oh, and Thanksgiving, which should offer a nation-wide opportunity for extremely awkward table conversations.

  yesterday: The open hearings in the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump hit hyperdrive this week with nine witnesses <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/11/13/20961074/impeachment-hearings-testimony-live-stream-taylor-kent">scheduled to testify</a>. Yesterday saw four of them testify in pairs over <i>eleven</i> hours—it was very, very long, but important, testimony from three people who were present on the president's call with Ukrainian president Zelensky on July 25. The verdict? Even among the witnesses <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/19/778657017/impeachment-hearings-resume-with-white-house-state-department-witnesses">chosen by Republicans</a>, it was "unusual" at best. All four witnesses also <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/impeachment-hearing-11-19-19/h_f30913e2622eb1fb31345ce33047f1fa">heavily implicated Rudy Giuliani and US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland</a> as lynchpins in all of this, which set up huge expectations for Sondland's testimony today. 
  todays: 
  - item: Another marathon day of testimony in the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump got off to a surprising start today when <b>US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland opened his testimony asking rhetorically "Was there a 'quid pro quo?'" and then answering, "the answer is yes."</b> <i>For real, y'all—this happened.</i> Sondland, who had been implicated as a central figure in the Ukraine controversy by almost every witness up to now, did not mince words. He testified that he aggressively pursued Ukraine's commitment to investigating the president's political rivals, in direct coordination with Rudy Giuliani, "at the express direction" of President Trump. It was remarkable. Read the whole opening statement. It is long but worth it.

  - item: <b>Sondland's testimony didn't just stop at the quid-pro-quo, but instead implicated an astounding number of people. "Everyone was in the loop. It was no secret,"</b> he explained. The people involved were so senior that Sondland pushed back on the idea that they represented an "irregular channel" of communication with Ukraine, which is how acting US ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor had described them in his testimony. "I'm not sure how someone could characterize something as an 'irregular' channel when you're talking to the President of the United States, the Secretary of State, the National Security Advisor, the Chief of Staff of the White House," he testified. "I don't know how they could consider us to be the 'irregular' channel and they to be the 'regular' channel when it's the leadership that makes decisions." <i>Well then.</i>

  - item: While Sondland repeatedly cited conversations <i>at all levels</i> tying an announcement of Ukrainian investigations into the Bidens and the 2016 election with a visit to the White House for the Ukrainian president, the connection of military aid for Ukraine never got as explicit a tie. "The aid was my own personal guess," he testified, based on "two plus two equals four." <b>Democrats pushed heavily to try and tie aid into the mix and, in the process, gave Republicans their only breathing room for the entire morning.</b> Sondland testified that he asked the president "what do you want" from Ukraine and that the president told him "I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing." 
    source: BBC
    url: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50493440
  - item: Did the White House grab at that admission with all they had? Of course they did. <b>President Trump, on his way to visit an Apple manufacturing facility in Austin Texas, was photographed holding hand-written notes that in huge Sharpied lettering read "I WANT NOTHING. I WANT NOTHING. I WANT NO QUID PRO QUO. TELL ZELENSKY TO DO THE RIGHT THING. THIS IS THE FINAL WORD FROM THE PRES OF THE U."</b> In addition to the President's Sharpie, Vice President Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and even Rudy Giuliani, pushed back on Sondland's testimony connecting all of them in the Ukrainian scheme.

  - item: The withheld Ukrainian aid was the focus of the <i>second</i> hearing of the day, which didn't get underway until nearly 6:00pm Eastern. At that hearing—which was kept mercifully short after Sondland's testimony stretched to seven hours—Laura Cooper, deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia and David Hale, under secretary of state for political affairs at the State Department, testified that neither of them—nor anyone they talked to at their respective departments—could explain why the $400 million of aid to Ukraine was on hold. Most interesting was that <b>Cooper set a new timeline for when the Ukrainians knew that the aid was put on hold</b>, which up until her testimony tonight was largely believed to be in late August. However, according to Cooper, her staff was fielding queries from Ukraine about the aid in July, including two emails on July 25, the same day President Trump had his call with Ukrainian president Zelensky. So, that's certainly something.

  - item: Think this never-ending week of testimony is over yet? <i>Not so fast!</i> Tomorrow, theoretically, brings open hearings to a close until (maybe) after Thanksgiving. <b>Things wrap tomorrow with another twofer testimony day&#58; Fiona Hill, former senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council, and David Holmes, a State Department official who works at the US Embassy in Ukraine.</b> At her closed-door deposition, Hill testified of a tenure at the NSC "filled with hateful calls, conspiracy theories," and at his, Holmes gave a detailed report of an overhead conversation between Sondland and President Trump, so tomorrow should be fairly wild. It may also be the final day of public testimony in this phase of the impeachment inquiry, but I wouldn't put any bets on that.

  tomorrow: If tomorrow's testimony really is the last in this phase of the impeachment inquiry—things would move to the Judiciary Committee after this—then expect plenty of fireworks. But, there are lots of people that have been implicated in this week's testimony and a few legal questions actively making their way through courts that may offer opportunities to compel their testimony, I wouldn't be surprised if things go past this week, which should make for wild Thanksgiving conversations.

  yesterday: Tuesday was so long, remembering back to the days before feels like looking through the mists of time. There was a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Unclassified09.2019.pdf">phone call</a>? A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/us/politics/mulvaney-transcript-quid-pro-quo.html">quid-pro-quo</a>?

It's all sort of fuzzy, like from a dream. <i>My god</i>, I am tired. Let's just get to today, shall we?
  todays: 
  - item: Tuesday's double-stacked impeachment inquiry—two witnesses in the morning, two in the afternoon—felt like a day that would never end. But, finally, <i>after over 11 hours of televised testimony</i>, it did. <i>Bursts into tears</i>. What did we learn after all this testimony? Largely that depended on where you fell on the ideological spectrum—which definitely applies to all these hearings, but was especially pronounced today as the two witnesses in the afternoon were specifically requested by Republicans, while the morning picks were by Democrats. That meant that <b>while a lot of the testimony overlapped—three of the four witnesses today were present for the July 25 call between President Trump and Ukrainian president Zelensky—there was divergence in the details, or at least in how they were interpreted.</b> Also, have I mentioned that it was a long day? <i>It was a very long day.</i> Let's break this down person by person&#58;
    source: 
    url:
  - item: In the morning, <b>Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, who wore his Army dress uniform, testified that he "couldn’t believe what I was hearing" when he listened in to the July 25 call between President Trump and Ukrainian president Zelensky.</b> "It was probably an element of shock—that maybe, in certain regards, my worst fear of how our Ukraine policy could play out was playing out, and how this was likely to have significant implications for US national security," he said. Vindman withstood attacks by Republicans, who attempted to question his loyalty to the country, and a tweet from the official White House account during his testimony that questioned his judgement. Why go through all this? "This is America," he explained. "This is the country I've served and defended—that all of my brothers have served—and here, right matters." Let's hope.

  - item: Also testifying in the morning was Jennifer Williams, national security aide to Vice President Pence. <b>Williams, who was also present for the July 25 call, described the call as "unusual" and said that it "involved discussion of what appeared to be a domestic political matter."</b> In the dozen or so calls between heads of state she'd been involved with before, she said, she'd never heard something like that brought up. Specifically, Williams testified, the reference to former VP Joe Biden "struck me as political in nature given that the former vice president is a political opponent of the president." I mean, yeah, that sounds right.

  - item: In his afternoon testimony, US special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker said that while he originally didn't think there was anything unusual in regards to his work with Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, and US ambassador to the EU Gordan Sondland—both of whom were working backchannels to Ukraine for the president—in retrospect he should have picked up on all the clues they were laying down. <i>Really</i>. <b>"In hindsight," Volker testified, "I now understand that others saw the idea of investigating possible corruption involving the Ukrainian company, Burisma, as equivalent to investigating former Vice President Biden. I saw them as very different. The former being appropriate and unremarkable, the latter being unacceptable."</b> Sure, OK man. "In retrospect"—which really could have been Volker's catchphrase for the day—"I should have seen that connection differently, and had I done so, I would have raised my own objections." Keep in mind, this was a guy Republicans <i>wanted</i> to testify.

  - item: Sitting alongside Volker was Tim Morrison, the former National Security Council advisor on Russia and Europe. Morrison, who only held that position for about four months, was present on the July 25th call as well. Immediately following the call—on which he testified he was "not concerned that anything illegal was discussed"—he recommended to NSC lawyers that the call be classified because its contents could leak. Which, <i>thinking guy emoji</i>. While he may not have heard anything illegal on the call he immediately recommended be classified—<i>stares</i>—he didn't hear a lot he liked either. <b>Morrison testified that while he prepared a lot of anti-corruption talking points for the president, Trump disregarded them and that the topics he <i>did</i> bring up—namely the Bidens and the DNC server—were "not what we recommended the President discuss."</b> Ya think?

And in Holmes's testimony he talked extensively about the phone call between ambassador Sondland and President Trump that he overheard.

And, tomorrow's a big one&#58; <b>Testifying in the morning is US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland</b>—provided he can get up from under the bus he was thrown under repeatedly today. Sondland has been a main player in all this for a while now but after the public testimony we've gotten so far, where he's been emerged as a truly central figure, there's a lot riding on him. For everyone. <i>I'm sure it will go great.</i> <b>In the afternoon we'll hear from both Laura Cooper, deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia, and David Hale, under secretary of state for political affairs at the State Department.</b> Oh, also once the hearings tomorrow wrap up, you can flip right over to the Democratic presidential debate which will start at 9pm Eastern. <i>Weeps inconsolably.</i>

The three officials, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/13/public-impeachment-hearings-live-highlights-and-updates-070279">who testified over two days</a>, told the House Intelligence Committee about <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/5-takeaways-public-testimony-n1081661">"side channels" of communication</a>—<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-attacks-ambassador-even-as-she-describes-feeling-threatened-by-him/2019/11/15/c14eefaa-07bc-11ea-8ac0-0810ed197c7e_story.html">run by Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, and Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU</a>—between the US and Ukraine that worked to undermine the work of officials like Yovanovich—<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/5-things-we-learned-marie-yovanovitch-s-impeachment-testimony-n1083341">who was fired this spring</a>—and were used to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/impeachment-public-hearings-live-stream-testimony-from-bill-taylor-george-kent-today-2019-11-13/">pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate the president's political rivals in return for military aid that was being withheld</a>. There was a lot. This week promises much, much more. Hang on. 
  todays: 
  - item: If you were hoping Monday was going to start out easy, President Trump took to Twitter early this morning to put an end to that. <b>In a multi-tweet diatribe, Trump wrote that while he "did nothing wrong," he'd "strongly consider" giving written testimony to House impeachment investigators.</b> <i>Stares</i> Of course, he did it while insulting Nancy Pelosi, the House Democrats, the impeachment inquiry, and the news show Face the Nation, so, well, maybe it wasn't the most sincere offer ever? Anyway, he ended his Twitter thread by saying "I like the idea & will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it." Let's just assume that's <i>definitely</i> going to happen.

  - item: Of course, even as the president said he'd consider providing written testimony to Congress, <b>the House was in court arguing that he may have lied in his written testimony provided to the Mueller investigation</b>. "There is evidence, very sadly, that the President might have provided untruthful answers and this is a key part of the impeachment inquiry," House general counsel Douglas Letter told the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit today. The House is in court to force the Department of Justice to turn over grand jury material from the Mueller investigation. On top of the questions the House is already attempting to answer by gaining access to these documents, Friday's conviction of Trump associate Roger Stone has opened questions as to whether Trump's written answers to Mueller in regards to what he knew about Stone's contacts with Wikileaks were untrue. So it's definitely a good idea to have him provide written testimony again, that's for sure.

  - item:  Meanwhile, fallout from last week's open impeachment hearings has reached the "palace intrigue" stage. NBC News reported today that <b>the "impeachment inquiry has created the first rift between President Donald Trump and the Cabinet member who has been his closest ally, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo."</b> Most of the testimony in the House impeachment inquiry—both closed-door and open—has come from current and former State Department officials. According to NBC, "Pompeo 'feels like he's getting a bunch of blame from the president and the White House for having hired all these people who are turning against Trump and that it's the State Department that is going to bring him down, so it's all Pompeo's fault.'"

During that call, Holmes testified that he heard the president ask Sondland if Ukrainian president Zelensky was "gonna do the investigation" into the Bidens, to which Sondland responded that Zelensky would do "anything you ask him to." Holmes will now testify alongside White House National Security Council official Fiona Hill on Thursday, making him the <i>ninth</i> witness scheduled to testify this week. Nine. <i>Cries</i>.

  yesterday: The first week of open hearings in the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump saw the testimony of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/politics/marie-yovanovitch-testimony.html">former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/13/trump-impeachment-hearings-070089">acting ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor, and State Department Ukraine expert George Kent</a>. Across the two days of testimony we learned much more about the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/transcript-of-envoy-bill-taylors-testimony-to-be-released-11573061931">hold placed on military aide for Ukraine and the demands for investigations into the president's political rivals</a> to ensure its release. Additionally, we learned more about the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/live-blog/trump-impeachment-inquiry-live-updates-latest-news-n1065706/ncrd1081691">"smear campaign"</a> waged against Yovanovich that <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/yovanovitch-says-she-was-told-to-return-to-the-u-s-on-the-next-plane">eventually lead to her firing</a>. It was a very full week that only continues to get fuller.  
  todays: 
  - item: The House Intelligence committee was back behind closed doors on Saturday to hear the testimony of Mark Sandy, deputy associate director for national security programs at the Office of Management and Budget. The Office of Management and Budget has been a missing link in testimony up to now, with the acting director and other officials defying Congressional subpoenas. The budget office is the administration arm that actually placed the hold on $400M of Ukrainian military aid that sits at the center of the impeachment inquiry. According to the Wall Street Journal, <b>Sandy told investigators that the hold was "unusual" and that he was never told why the money needed to be held back.</b> Regardless, Sandy signed off on the hold on July 25, the same day as President Trump's call wtih Ukrainian president Zelensky.

  - item: Saturday also saw the release of two transcripts from last month's closed-door depositions&#58; Tim Morrison, a Russia expert on the National Security Counsel, and Jennifer Williams, a national security aide to VP Pence. <b>Morrison, who was listening in on the president's July 25 call with Ukrainian president Zelensky, testified that even though he didn't think the president did anything illegal on the call—though the mention of investigations "seemed unusual"—he told NSC lawyers they should restrict access to the call transcript because the contents might leak.</b> <i>Sure, why not.</i> Morison also testified that he was concerned about alternative channels in US/Ukraine communications led by US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland. "At some point I became concerned that this parallel process was going to turn into something—and here we are." Here we are indeed.

  - item: If "unusual" seems like the word of the day in this update, <i>that's because it is!</i> In the other transcript released yesterday, <b>Vice President Pence's national security aide Jennifer Williams, described Trump's request to investigate political opponents "unusual and inappropriate"</b> and that she viewed Trump's requests to be "more specific to the president in nature, to his personal political agenda, as opposed to a broader … foreign policy objective of the United States." Additionally, Williams testified that Ukrainian energy company Burisma was mentioned on the July 25th call, but there's no mention of Burisma in the summary transcript of the call released by the White House which, <i>thinking face emoji</i>.

  - item: Speaking of discrepancies in White House call transcripts, <b>the Friday release of a rough transcript of an earlier call between Trump and Zelensky raised some questions because it diverged significantly from the original summary of the call back in April</b>. The original summary said the two talked about working together to "root out corruption," which doesn't appear in the new transcript at all. The reason? Apparently the summary was written in advance of the call and, "because the call occurred on a Sunday, likely wasn’t updated." I got nothing.

After the meeting, which took place during the White House Hanukkah party, <b>Parnas told people he was on "a secret mission" from the president to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate the Bidens</b>. <i>This happened during the White House Hanukkah party</i>, I can not stress that enough. Parnas "told everyone in Ukraine about the White House meeting," Ken McCallion, a former federal prosecutor with numerous high-level clients in Ukraine told CNN. "He was adamant he was 'their guy'—that they chose him to be their ambassador in Ukraine." Meanwhile <i>in actual reality</i>, Parnas was one of the people, along with Fruman and Giuliani, cited by former US ambassador Marie Yovanovitch as involved in the "smear campaign" that lead to her ouster as ambassador.

  tomorrow: Open testimony in the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump resumes on Tuesday with <i>eight</i> witnesses scheduled for this week. That's more than twice as many as this past week if you need a good sense of just how bananas things are going to get.

  yesterday: Welcome to the end of the first full week of open impeachment hearings! Wednesday saw <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/13/trump-impeachment-hearings-070089">testimony by acting ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor and George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs</a> that outlined the contours of the case the Democrats are making against the president. That brings us to today, which had more public testimony and then literally everything else too. There is a lot. <i>Lololol.</i>
  todays: 
  - item: The second public hearing in the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump took place in the House of Representatives today. <b>The House Intelligence Committee questioned former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch for hours about the circumstances surrounding her abrupt firing from her post this spring</b>. Over the course of her testimony, Yovanovitch outlined the smear campaign against her run by Rudy Giuliani and ousted former Ukrainian prosecutors. "When our anti-corruption efforts got in the way of a desire for profit or power, Ukrainians who preferred to play by the old, corrupt rules sought to remove me," she testified. "What continues to amaze me is that they found Americans willing to partner with them and, working together, they apparently succeeded in orchestrating the removal of a US Ambassador." In her testimony, she asked a very simple question that is endemic to this whole mess&#58; "How could our system fail like this?"

  - item: Unbelievably, <b>while Yovanovitch was testifying about feeling attacked by President Trump during his July 25 call with Ukrainian president Zelensky, Trump took to Twitter to, well, attack her again.</b> <i>For real</i>. "Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad," he tweeted. "She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him." <i>I just. I can't.</i> A few minutes later, House Intelligence chair Adam Schiff interrupted the Democratic lawyer's questioning to read the tweet to ambassador Yovanovitch, who visibly slumped in her chair on hearing it, saying "It’s very intimidating." Schiff responded&#58; "Some of us here take witness intimidation very, very seriously." <i>I genuinely can't believe that happened</i>, yet here we are.

  - item: Finally—<i>finally</i>—the day began with what seemed like an attempt to get a leg up on the news cycle when <b>the White House released a rough transcript of another call Trump had with Ukrainian president Zelensky</b>. This call, held days after Zelensky's election in April, involved little more than congratulations between the men. That should have been that, except that the transcript they released "bared little resemblance" to the summary of the call the White House originally released back in April, the Associated Press found. Specificaly, that original summary said that the two discussed ways to help Ukraine "implement reforms that strengthen democracy, increase prosperity, and root out corruption," but there was no discussion of corruption on the call. So like, <i>huh?</i> Also missing from the original summary was a discussion about Ukrainian beauty pageant contestants. "When I owned Miss Universe, they always had great people," Trump said to Zelensky, according to the new transcript. <i>Falls to ground. Shatters into dust.</i>

  yesterday: Yesterday the first public impeachment hearings in the inquiry against Donald Trump were held. William Taylor, acting US ambassador to the Ukraine, and George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/13/trump-impeachment-hearings-070089">answered questions by both Democrats and Republicans for about five hours</a>. It was the first open hearing of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry-live-updates/2019/11/12/229f5484-04de-11ea-8292-c46ee8cb3dce_story.html">many to come</a> and was the first public look at the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=democrats+case+against+trump&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS727US727&oq=democrats+case+against+trump&aqs=chrome..69i57.4729j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">case Democrats are building</a> against the president. 
  todays: 
  - item: The big revelation from yesterday's impeachment hearing, that US ambassador to Ukraine Gordon Sondland was overheard having a phone conversation with President Trump in Kyiv the day after Trump's July call with Ukrainian president Zelensky, was backed up by a second witness today. Because of course it was. <b>According to the Associated Press, a second diplomatic staffer at the same restaurant overheard the conversation between Sondland and Trump as well.</b> On the call, which William Taylor testified about yesterday, Trump was overheard <i>yelling through the phone</i> about "investigations" into the Bidens. When asked about the call today, Trump told reporters that he didn't remember making that call "not even a little bit." Well OK then.

  - item: Repercussions from yesterday's testimony found their way to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's weekly press conference today. <b>Pelosi told reporters that the testimony "corroborated evidence of bribery uncovered in the inquiry."</b> Which, I mean, that's been clear for a while right? The key part of the statement was Pelosi's use of the word "bribery" which is specifically used in the Constitution as an impeachable offense&#58; "treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors." Since "high crimes and misdemeanors" is open to interpretation, the belief is that "bribery" is the incantation that gives far less wiggle room. Maybe smash a horcrux or two to be safe.

Senator Kevin Cramer told the Wall Street Journal. "And he just shuffled it across the table and I read it and gave it back." It's worth noting that the Republican Senators he shared the transcript with will be jurors on his impeachment trial if it reaches the Senate so like, <i>lol nothing matters</i>. Anyway, in a Tweet this Monday, Trump said he'd release the "transcript of the first, and therefore more important, phone call with the Ukrainian President before week’s end." So we've got <i>that</i> to look forward to even if we're not Republican Senators maybe I guess.

  - item: Finally, <b>the open impeachment hearings continue <i>tomorrow</i> with the testimony of former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch</b>. Yovanovitch was the recipient of a lengthy smear campaign masterminded by Rudy Giuliani that lead to her ouster as ambassador earlier this year.

Yovanovitch's testimony will begin at 10am Eastern tomorrow and follow the same format as Wednesday's&#58; Opening statements, followed by 90 minutes of questioning by Democratic and Republican lawyers (45 minutes per), followed by 5 minute rounds of a jacketless Representative Jim Jordan yelling—<i>er</i>, I mean 5 minute rounds of Committee member questions, alternating between Republican and Democrat.

  yesterday: I could give a long, history-filled preamble of what has lead us to today, as I've done every day this week. But let's face it&#58; Wednesday, November 13 was the first day of the public impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump and let's just get straight to that shall we?
  todays: 
  - item: <b>For only the third time in modern presidential history, the House of Representatives today started hearings that could result in the impeachment of a sitting president.</b> The questioning of William Taylor, acting US ambassador to the Ukraine, and George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, lasted from 10am until 2:30pm Eastern with only short breaks throughout. The hearing was a mix of courtroom—the first 90 minutes of questioning was largely done by lawyers representing Republicans and Democrats—and clownshow—every Rep still got five minutes to either ask questions or showboat in the last two hours—and testimony largely covered ground that Taylor and Kent had previously covered in their closed-door testimony last month. But public testimony is very different than reading transcripts and it was historic however you cut it. This phase of the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump has officially begun.

  - item: The biggest revelation of the day's testimony came early when <b>Ambassador Taylor described an previously-unknown phone call between President Trump and US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland</b>—a central figure in the US/Ukraine narrative that sits at the center of the impeachment proceedings. The phone call took place on July 26, the day after the now-infamous call between Trump and Ukrainian president Zelensky, and was overheard by one of Taylor's staffers. On the call, Trump—who was speaking loud enough that Taylor's staffer could hear him through the phone—asked Sondland about "the investigations" which Sondland then responded were "ready to move forward." After the call, Taylor's staffer asked Sondland what Trump thought about Ukraine. “Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for," Taylor testified. That quote, that the President cared more about investigating Biden than he cared about Ukraine, came up in questioning repeatedly after Taylor dropped it.

  - item: Taylor, a career diplomat who speaks in a deep Leonard-Nimoy-esque bass, repeatedly centered his testimony around Ukraine and its importance in the global order. <b>In his opening statement, he labored to remind Congressmembers and the public that "there are two Ukraine stories today."</b> The first "is the one we are discussing this morning and that you have been hearing for the past two weeks. It is a rancorous story about whistleblowers, Mr Giuliani, side channels, quid pro quos, corruption, and interference in elections. In this story, Ukraine is merely an object." He continued&#58; "But there is another Ukraine story—a positive, bipartisan one. In this second story, Ukraine is the subject. This one is about young people in a young nation struggling to break free of its past." It was a human moment in a hearing that was largely absent of them.

  - item: For his part George Kent—dressed like the natty professor in a tweed suit and bow tie—spent a good deal of his testimony defending other diplomats who he felt were the recipients of a Rudy Giuliani-led "campaign to smear." <b>Along with Giuliani and his associates, Kent testified that the "chief agitators" on the Ukrainian side were prosecutors fired for corruption who were "now peddling false information in order to exact revenge against those who had exposed their misconduct."</b> Sound like great guys all around.

  - item: <b>Republicans on the committee spent much of the four and a half hours attempting to shift the inquiry toward—who else—Joe and Hunter Biden as well as revisiting conspiracy theories from the 2016 election.</b> The Republican position was summed up most succinctly by Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes who, in his closing statement, said that that the House "should stop holding these hearings until we get the answer to three important topics." Those topics? "Democrats prior coordination with the whistleblower. … Second, the full extent of the Ukraine's meddling against the Trump campaign. … And third why did Burisma hire Hunter Biden and what did he do for them." <i>Screams into the void forever.</i>

  tomorrow: With former Ambassador Yovanovitch testifying Friday, Thursday should be a day to for Democrats and Republicans to sift through what happened today and prepare their best spin for Friday. I'd almost say it'll be a chill day but we all know that that would be a lie. Also, Thursday is my birthday. <i>Cries.</i>

  yesterday: This is it. 50 days ago, on September 24, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/democrats-impeachment-trump.html">Nancy Pelosi announced that an impeachment inquiry was underway</a> after a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/read-the-whistleblower-complaint-regarding-president-trump-s-communications-with-ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelensky/4b9e0ca5-3824-467f-b1a3-77f2d4ee16aa/">whistleblower alerted Congress</a> to a potential quid-pro-quo <a href="https://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=6429015-Trump-Ukraine-Transcript">in a call</a> between President Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. After investigating for a little more than a month behind closed doors, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/house-to-vote-on-rules-governing-next-phase-of-trump-impeachment-inquiry/2019/10/31/bc2f5e7a-fbcc-11e9-ac8c-8eced29ca6ef_story.html">the full House voted</a> on Halloween to officially authorize the impeachment inquiry. In the two weeks since that vote, House investigative committees have wrapped their closed-door depositions and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/11/8/20954212/impeachment-transcripts-sondland-taylor-today-explained">released extensive transcripts</a> from that testimony. And now, tomorrow, the open inquiry begins. Let's do this.
  todays: 
  - item: <b>Public hearings in the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump begin tomorrow.</b> Damn right that's going to lead today's update. Tomorrow will see dual testimony from William Taylor, acting US ambassador to the Ukraine, and George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs. Yes, they're testifying at the same time. No, I don't know why. The full schedule for tomorrow&#58;<ul><li>The hearing will begin at 10am Eastern.</li><li>From there, Democrat Adam Schiff, House Intelligence Committee chair, and Republican Devin Nunes, ranking member, will make opening statements followed by opening statements from Taylor and Kent.</li><li>Following opening statements, both Schiff and Nunes, and designated committee lawyers, will get 45 minutes each to question witnesses.</li><li>After that, each member of the committee will get five minutes each to ask questions, swapping between Democrat and Republican. There are 22 members of the committee, so that's—<i>does math</i>—110 minutes.</li><li>As of now, it's expected that things will wrap up between 2&#58;30 and 4&#58;30 Eastern.</li> </ul>
  - item: To kick things off for tomorrow, <b>House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff wrote a letter to House members today</b>. The letter—which much of the above timeline comes from—gives both rules and context for impeachment hearings, restates the parameters of the questioning tomorrow, which is supposed to be tightly focused on the president's conduct in regards to Ukraine, and underscores that the inquiry "will not serve as venues for any Member to further the same sham investigations into the Bidens or into debunked conspiracies about 2016 US election interference that President Trump pressed Ukraine to undertake for his personal political benefit." We'll see how <i>that</i> goes. "Above all," Schiff wrote, "these hearings are intended to bring the facts to light for the American people." Here we go.

  tomorrow: This is it&#58; Open impeachment proceedings begin tomorrow with the testimony of William Taylor and George Kent, followed by a second hearing on Friday with former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. This is only the third time in modern presidential history that this has happened. It's go time, let's see some hustle, and all that stuff. 
- date: 2019-11-11
  yesterday: All the final preparations for this week's start of public impeachment hearings are in motion. In addition to the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/11/8/20954212/impeachment-transcripts-sondland-taylor-today-explained">release of a steady stream of transcripts</a> from the last month of closed-door depositions, over the weekend, House Republicans sent a <a href="https://republicans-intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/rm_letter_to_chm_re_witness_request.pdf">very ambitious list</a> of witnesses they'd like to call (spoiler alert&#58; they won't get many of them). And with that, we've suddenly reached <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/11/politics/house-impeachment-schedule-guide/index.html">open impeachment inquiry week</a>. Here we go.
  todays: 
  - item: Monday was the quietest day we'll have all week, with both a federal holiday today and the (relative) calm before the storm of public impeachment hearings starts on Wednesday. Today did bring the official schedule for those public hearings, with House Intelligence chair <b>Adam Schiff's office announcing that things will kick off at 10am Wednesday with the dual testimony of William Taylor, acting US ambassador to the Ukraine, and George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs</b>. Taylor's closed-door testimony included a detailed outline of the "irregular channels" of communication with Ukraine run by Rudy Giuliani. Kent's previous testimony attested to a "campaign of lies" that lead to the firing of former Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who testifies in the open on Friday. This is really happening—set your DVRs.

  - item: Despite the federal holiday, transcripts from the last month of closed-door depositions continued to be released. <b>Today saw the release of transcripts of testimony from Laura Cooper—deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia—and Catherine Croft and Christopher Anderson, two State Department Ukraine specialists</b>. The transcripts continue to flesh out an understanding of both the hold placed on aid to Ukraine that sits at the center of the impeachment inquiry as well as the involvement of the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, in Ukrainian affairs. In his testimony Anderson said that National Security Advisor John Bolton "made a joke about every time Ukraine is mentioned, Giuliani pops up." So basically, Giuliani is like the Candyman, only <i>terrible</i>.

  - item: While the final lineup of people called to testify in this phase of the impeachment inquiry is still being settled, one person we officially won't hear from is the whistleblower who kicked everything off with their report to Congress in September. Republicans—and the president himself (more on that in a sec)—have wanted to call the whistleblower, but in responding to their request, <b>Adam Schiff said that the Intelligence Committee "will not facilitate efforts by President Trump and his allies in Congress to threaten, intimidate, and retaliate against the whistleblower"</b> and that the whistleblower has a right to remain anonymous. That's going to go over great I am sure. 
    source: CNN

  - item: Even though hearings begin in two days, the Republican strategy for the impeachment continues to evolve, with <b>Representative Jim Jordan temporarily assigned to the House Intelligence Committee so he can sit in on the open hearings</b>. Jordan was one of the Republicans that lead the occupation of the secure room where depositions were being held last month as a way of protesting the closed-door nature of the hearings—despite the fact that he had full access to the hearings as the head Republican on the House Oversight Committee. "You want your best contributors for 'showtime,'" one Republican told Politico. "Jordan is definitely a showman." <i>Stares</i>.

  - item: Finally, <b>the president spent much of the day tweeting about the impeachment proceedings</b>, including saying that "the Whistleblower, his lawyer, and Corrupt politician Schiff should be investigated for fraud!" He paused his tweeting to take part in New York's Veterans Day Parade. When he started again a few hours later, he accused Adam Schiff of having "fabricated my phone call, he will fabricate the transcripts that he is making and releasing!" I'm sure the rest of the week is going to go great.

  tomorrow: Over the weekend President Trump claimed that on Tuesday he would release a summary transcript of another call he had with Ukrainian president Zelensky. Maybe that will happen? If not, expect more transcripts from testimony to be released by Democrats, more accusations from Republicans about the proceedings not being fair, and more planning by Democrats for those proceedings to proceed anyway. We're just two days away now.
- date: 2019-11-10
  yesterday: After the announcement of an impeachment inquiry in the House on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/democrats-impeachment-trump.html">September 24</a>, the month of closed-door testimony that followed, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/house-to-vote-on-rules-governing-next-phase-of-trump-impeachment-inquiry/2019/10/31/bc2f5e7a-fbcc-11e9-ac8c-8eced29ca6ef_story.html">vote to move the inquiry to a new, more public, phase</a> on October 31, and last week's <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/11/8/20954212/impeachment-transcripts-sondland-taylor-today-explained">release of transcripts</a> from testimony, we are now just a few days away from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/house-to-hold-first-open-hearings-in-impeachment-inquiry-of-trump/2019/11/06/90041c3c-00bd-11ea-9518-1e76abc088b6_story.html">open impeachment hearings</a>, which begin on Wednesday. If you thought things moved fast before, well hang on. 
  todays: 
  - item: <b>Republican House members had a deadline of Saturday to produce their wish list of witnesses for the next phase of the impeachment inquiry</b>. How's it looking? Well, it's "a list that includes former vice president Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden"—<i>stares</i>—"and the anonymous whistleblower who filed the initial complaint against President Trump. What's the strategy here? "Republicans want to publicly question witnesses who would divert the conversation away from questions about Trump’s behavior to allegations only tangentially related to the case," writes the Washington Post. <i>Checks out</i>. However, Democrats have final say on who actually gets called, so expect "failure to fulfill Minority witness requests shall constitute evidence of your denial of fundamental fairness and due process" to become a talking point when half these folks aren't called. <i>I need a nap</i>.

  - item: From putting "impeachment inquiry" in quotes every time he uses it, to the list of witnesses that reads like a greatest-hits collection of three years of conspiracy theories—including a DNC staffer who "can assist Congress and the American public in better understanding the facts and circumstances surrounding Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election"—<b>the entirety of Devin Nunes's letter is worth a read</b>. This is an actual document in an actual inquiry in actual Congress. <i>Lights self on fire</i>.

  - item: The GOP list wasn't the only Republican maneuvering happening this weekend. Late Friday night, <b>acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney asked to join the lawsuit requesting a judicial decision on whether White House staff should comply with House subpoenas or White House directives of non-compliance</b>. Does this mean that the chief of staff of the White House is attempting to sue the White House? Yes, yes it does. The lawsuit, originally filed by National Security Counsel deputy Charles Kupperman, is also holding up the testimony of National Security Advisor John Bolton. The first hearing is scheduled for December 10. <i>Checks calendar. Bursts into tears</i>.

  - item: Speaking of John Bolton, <b>a puzzling report from Bloomberg on Saturday placed Bolton at the center of the release of the withheld funds to Ukraine</b>. "Shortly before September 9, Bolton had relayed a message to the State Department that the funding could go ahead. It’s not clear whether Bolton, who resigned from the job a week later, did so with Trump’s approval," Bloomberg reports. <i>Wait what?</i> This report directly contradicts the White House's narrative that Trump himself lifted the hold on the money on September 11 after a phone call with Republican Senator Rob Portman. "I gave the money because Rob Portman and others called me and asked," Trump told reporters last month. The hold and later release of Ukrainian aid—and who knew what when—is a key element of the impeachment inquiry. My head genuinely hurts.

  - item: If that isn't enough for one weekend, <b>President Trump told reporters yesterday that the White House was readying the release of a second transcript summary with Ukrainian president Zelensky</b>. "We have another transcript coming out which is very important," he told reporters before going to a football game Saturday. He said that the summary, from a call in April after Zelensky won the Ukrainian election, would be released on Tuesday, a day before open impeachment hearings begin. Sure, why not.

  tomorrow: Hey, Monday is a federal holiday so nobody's really supposed to be doing any work. But it's also two days before open impeachment hearings begin, there's the potential of a new Ukrainian transcript, and a lot of back-and-forthing about witnesses to deal with so... <i>weeps for an uncomfortably long time.</i> 
- date: 2019-11-08
  yesterday: After a month of closed-door testimony and a week of <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/11/8/20954212/impeachment-transcripts-sondland-taylor-today-explained">transcripts</a> from that testimony being released, we're just a few days away from the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/house-to-hold-first-open-hearings-in-impeachment-inquiry-of-trump/2019/11/06/90041c3c-00bd-11ea-9518-1e76abc088b6_story.html">first open hearings</a> in this impeachment inquiry. This week has largely been about clearing the deck for those hearings&#58; regular release of transcripts, strategy sessions by both <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/07/house-republicans-want-whistleblower-testify-public-impeachment-hearings-067292">Democrats</a> and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/as-impeachment-inquiry-enters-public-phase-republicans-consider-moving-jim-jordan-to-house-intelligence-committee/">Republicans</a>, and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/02/politics/democrats-impeachment-next-steps/index.html">generally maneuvering</a> to prepare for the show. Here we go.
  todays: 
  - item: As the House prepares for open hearings next week, two more transcripts from last month's closed-door testimony were released. The first, by Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, the director for European affairs for the National Security Council, gave a vivid look into the July 25 call between president Trump and Ukrainian president Zelensky. "I’m struggling for the words," he told investigators, "but it was not a positive call." <b>When asked if there was any doubt in his mind that Trump was asking Zelensky to investigate his political rivals as a "deliverable," Vindman responded "There was no doubt."</b> <i>Well then.</i> Of course that wasn't enough for Republican Rep John Ratcliffe who pressed Vindman to define what he meant by a "deliverable."  Vindman explained further&#58; "it became completely apparent what the deliverable would be in order to get a White House meeting. That deliverable was reinforced by the President. … The demand was, in order to get the White House meeting, they had to deliver an investigation."

  - item: The transcript of Fiona Hill, senior director for European and Russian affairs on the National Security Council was also released today. <b>In her deposition, Hill describes a hellish tenure at the NSC "filled with hateful calls, conspiracy theories … accusing me of being a Soros mole in the White House, of colluding with all kinds of enemies of the president, and, you know, of various improprieties."</b> I've had some bad jobs, but <i>omg</i>. When she reported this to her boss, John Bolton, he told her to go to NSC lawyer John Eisenberg&#58; "You go and tell Eisenberg that I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up on this, and you go and tell him what you've heard and what I've said." Well OK then.

    url: https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/08/fiona-hill-impeachment-testimony-released-067908
  - item: Speaking of Fiona Hill's boss John Bolton, the former National Security Advisor continues to be a mustachioed enigma in these proceedings, appearing as a critical voice in many transcripts but refusing to appear. <b>Today his lawyer said that John Bolton knows about "many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far."</b> Well, out with it then, right? Not so fast—his lawyer wants a judge to decide whether Bolton should abide by House subpoena or the White House directive of non-cooperation. If that sounds familiar it's because Bolton's lawyer is the same lawyer as Charles Kupperman who has already sued for the same reason. His case is being heard December 10, so it may be a while before we hear about those "relevant meetings and conversations."

  - item: While we're talking about not appearing, <b>White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney refused to comply with a subpoena today and skipped his hearing with House investigators</b>. You are <i>shocked</i>, I know. He waited until literally the last minute to do it, according to Time. "Mulvaney’s lawyer informed the committees leading the impeachment probe one minute before the deposition was supposed to start that Mulvaney had been directed not to comply with the subpoena." So there's your fun fact for the day.

    url: https://time.com/5722548/mick-mulvaney-skip-impeachment-inquiry/
  - item: <b>If you were wondering how next week's public hearings were weighing on the president, he's "not concerned about anything,"</b> he told White House reporters today. <i>Hmmmmm</i>. "The testimony has all been fine," he said (side note&#58; <i>it hasn't</i>). "I mean, for the most part, I never even heard of these people. I have no idea who they are," which is a little odd because he appointed a number of them. Anyway, he added that "They shouldn't be having public hearings; this is a hoax." <i>Screams into the void for all eternity.</i> Public hearings begin on Wednesday.

  tomorrow: Before public hearings begin next week, Republicans have a deadline of <i>tomorrow</i> to submit the list of witnesses they'd like to call in the hearings. Since Democrats have final say on who actually will be testifying, expect a lot of fireworks over the weekend. Good thing we update on Sunday mid-day. Keep an eye out. And, like, hydrate and get extra sleep or something—next week is going to be a long one. Maybe this is just advice for me. <i>Cries</i>.

  yesterday: We're in the thick of the pregame for the start of open impeachment hearings following <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/house-to-vote-on-rules-governing-next-phase-of-trump-impeachment-inquiry/2019/10/31/bc2f5e7a-fbcc-11e9-ac8c-8eced29ca6ef_story.html">last week's floor vote</a> to formally authorize the impeachment investigation that has been underway since September 24. The House Intelligence Committee has been <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/05/776331817/new-transcripts-of-closed-door-depositions-released-in-trump-impeachment-inquiry">releasing transcripts of closed-door testimony</a> collected over the last month and setting up the ground rules and schedule for <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/first-public-hearings-trump-impeachment-inquiry-begin-next-week-schiff-n1077371">public testimony which will begin next Wednesday</a>. That's soon.
  todays: 
  - item: Preparation for next week's start of open impeachment hearings continued today with <b>Democrats revealing the three questions they are using as the "official parameters" of  public hearings</b>&#58; <ul><li>Did the President request that a foreign leader and government initiate investigations to benefit the President's personal political interests in the United States, including an investigation related to the President's political rival and potential opponent in the 2020 US presidential election?</li><li>Did the President–directly or through agents–seek to use the power of the Office of the President and other instruments of the federal government in other ways to apply pressure on the head of state and government of Ukraine to advance the President's personal political interests, including by leveraging an Oval Office meeting desired by the President of Ukraine or by withholding US military assistance to Ukraine?</li><li>Did the President and his Administration seek to obstruct, suppress or cover up information to conceal from the Congress and the American people evidence about the President's actions and conduct?</li></ul>These tightly-focused inquiry parameters appear to be an attempt to keep the next phase of the impeachment inquiry—which will allow Republicans to call their own witnesses as well—dialed into the key question of presidential abuse of power. Next week is going to be <i>bonkers</i> isn't it.

  - item: As <b>Republicans draw up their list of potential witnesses they'd like to call, their number one appears to be the anonymous whistleblower who kicked off the whole impeachment inquiry</b>. How would an anonymous whistleblower testify in an open hearing? Well, according to Republican Rep Mark Meadows, "The whistleblower statute never required for anonymity." Which, <i>thinking face emoji</i>. Republicans have until Saturday to deliver their list of witnesses to Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff. But—<i>twist</i>—Democrats have veto power on anyone on their list so all bets are off on who actually makes it through.

  - item: In addition to figuring out their list of potential witnesses, Republicans are also deciding if they want to shift the makeup of their side of the Intelligence Committee, which will lead this stage of the inquiry. Specifically, <b>Republicans are considering moving Jim Jordan, currently the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, over to Intelligence</b>. Why make the move?

  - item: Meanwhile, actual work got done too, with <b>Jennifer Williams, an advisor to VP Pence on Europe and Russia, testifying today</b>. The White House attempted to block Williams, but she appeared under subpoena. This is potentially a "what did the Vice President know and when did he know it" moment for the inquiry, as Williams is the first person from Pence's staff to give a deposition. While we don't yet know what she covered, her lawyer said "we expect her testimony will largely reflect what is already in the public record." After the release of thousands of pages of transcripts this week, there is <i>a lot</i> in the public record.

  - item: Speaking of transcripts, the House Intelligence Committee also released the transcript of the testimony of State Department official George Kent today. <b>In his testimony, Kent said that "POTUS wanted nothing less than President Zelenskyy to go to microphone and say investigations, Biden, and Clinton."</b> <i>Whaaaaaat.</i> Kent is one of three people giving open testimony next week so, uh, that should be something.

"<b>Finally bending to the White House request, Mr Zelensky's staff planned for him to make an announcement in an interview on September 13</b>" What stopped him? Word that the White House had frozen aid to Ukraine leaked out and, two days before the interview was scheduled, "the Trump administration released the assistance and Mr Zelensky’s office quickly canceled the interview." <i>Stares off into the middle distance.</i>

If the GOP is really going to put Jim Jordan on the Intelligence Committee (<i>sure, why not</i>), that should be happening shortly. Additionally, they have to get that wish list of potential witnesses in by Saturday. It's getting very real now. Hang on to something.

  yesterday: On Halloween, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/house-to-vote-on-rules-governing-next-phase-of-trump-impeachment-inquiry/2019/10/31/bc2f5e7a-fbcc-11e9-ac8c-8eced29ca6ef_story.html">the House of Representatives took a floor vote to formally authorize the impeachment investigation</a> that has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/democrats-impeachment-trump.html">underway since late September</a>. The vote, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/31/us/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry-house-vote.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage">which split largely along party lines</a>, outlined the next steps for the impeachment inquiry, which is investigating whether President Trump abused his power by connecting the release of military aid to Ukraine with Ukraine investigating his political rivals. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/us/politics/impeachment-resolution-trump.html">Those next steps</a> included the release of transcripts of closed-door testimony collected up to now, and the promise of a more public phase of the inquiry. 
  todays: 
  - item: The "public phase" of the impeachment inquiry got a start date today. After last week's floor vote in the House, the impeachment inquiry has looked pretty much the same, with closed-door testimony scheduled all week. But that stops next week when <b>the first public testimony in the impeachment inquiry will be held Wednesday, November 13</b>. That day will see <i>two</i> televised testimonies by William Taylor, acting US ambassador to the Ukraine, and George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs. Former US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch—who, according to testimony over the last month, was smeared repeatedly by Trump loyalists before being fired—is scheduled to testify publicly  on Friday the 15th. All three were previously deposed by House investigative committees, but now will testify in an open, televised setting. Cue the fireworks.

  - item: Between now and then, House committees will continue to release transcripts of the closed-door testimony taken over the last month. <b>Today, transcripts of the ten-hour testimony of William Taylor were released</b>. Over the lengthy transcripts, Taylor paints a picture of US Ukraine policy running through Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, instead of diplomats—as he calls it, a "regular channel" (US diplomats) and an "irregular channel" (Giuliani and various cronies). "The irregular channel seemed to focus on specific issues, specific cases, rather than the regular channel's focus on institution building," Taylor testified. Those specific issues? Take a guess. Taylor's detailed testimony gives extensive names and dates thanks in part to his extensive notetaking. As he explains, "I keep a little notebook where I take notes on conversations, in particular when I’m not in the office. So, in meetings with Ukrainian officials or when I'm out and I get a phone call and I can—I keep notes." All hail the notetakers.

  - item: The release of another transcript this week resulted in a dramatic revision. <b>Gordon Sondland, US ambassador to the EU, revised his previous testimony, now admitting in a sworn statement that "resumption of the US aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anticorruption statement."</b> The revision is the first time Sondland has admitted that the White House attached conditions to the release of military aide to Ukraine—a big reversal from his original testimony where he repeatedly said he didn't believe that there were. I don't know quite how you can just idly add that in that later and it's all cool, but here we are.

  - item: Even as transcripts are released (and, uh, revised) and the House gears up for public testimony next week, investigators continue to hold closed-door depositions as well—or at least are trying to. <b>While David Hale, under secretary of state for political affairs at the State Department, showed up to testify today, three others, including energy secretary Rick Perry, no-showed.</b> While Perry was not under subpoena, Russel Vought, acting director of the Office of Management and Budget and Ulrich Brechbul, a State Department official who listened to Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian president Zelensky, had both been issued subpoenas after no-showing previously. What to do about all these no-shows? Well, according to the New York Times, Adam Schiff has "indicated he will count refusals to appear as part of an article of impeachment against Mr Trump for obstruction of Congress." K, that works.

  - item: Finally, speaking of subpoenas, <b>House Democrats announced today that they've given up pursuing a subpoena for former deputy national security advisor Charles Kupperman, who had filed a lawsuit asking a judge to determine if he should comply</b>. Earlier this week a judge set a hearing date of December 10th, more than a month away and well into the public phase of the impeachment inquiry. Instead of pursuing this suit, House Democrats told Kupperman's attorney that they hope "Kupperman will comply with an upcoming ruling in a similar case involving former White House counsel Don McGahn." Definitely <i>hoping</i> is going to go great here I'm sure.

  tomorrow: House investigators heard a lot of testimony over the last month, so expect more transcripts to be released this week. Each transcript is hundreds of pages long, so even as new ones are released you can expect further revelations from ones released earlier in the week as well. I mean, who doesn't love transcripts, <i>right</i>? Oh, just me? Well, pretty soon we'll be getting testimony live on TV so I hope nobody had any plans for—<i>checks notes</i>—the entire month of November. <i>Cries.</i>

  yesterday: On September 24, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/democrats-impeachment-trump.html">Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry against President Trump</a> for allegedly withholding aid for Ukraine unless the Ukrainians investigated his political rivals. Over the last few weeks, House investigative committees <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-whistleblower-summary-factb/factbox-the-trump-impeachment-inquiry-what-weve-learned-so-far-idUSKBN1X82BM">have accumulated testimony from many officials</a> that corroborate that narrative (which has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/us/politics/mick-mulvaney-trump-ukraine.html">essentially been corroborated by the White House</a> as well). This week, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/28/house-to-vote-on-resolution-establishing-next-steps-in-impeachment-inquiry-000302">Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced</a> that after the last month of closed-door investigations, the impeachment inquiry would move into a new phase.
  todays: 
  - item: Welcome to the official impeachment inquiry! <b>The House of Representatives voted today to formally authorize the impeachment inquiry that has been underway for the last month and to move it into a new, more public phase.</b> This is only the third time in modern history that the House has voted on an impeachment inquiry of a president, so like, take a moment here. "What is at stake in all of this is nothing less than our democracy," said Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who on Monday introduced this resolution. The resolution outlines the next steps of the impeachment inquiry, now focused heavily on public hearings starting in November which will almost certainly lead to articles of impeachment being filed and a vote taken maybe before the winter holidays. Things just got very real.

  - item: Today's historic vote was also a moment of truth for lawmakers who may have been reluctant to put their names to an impeachment vote. <b>The final vote fell almost entirely on party lines, with 232 voting to approve and 196 opposed</b>. Two Democrats—Collin Peterson of Minnesota and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey—joined every Republican in voting against the resolution. Justin Amash, who left the Republican party earlier this year, voted in favor. If you want to see the whole list of names, the New York Times has a good look at how everyone voted.

According to the Washington Post, <b>Vindman testified that when he raised concerns about the president's July 25 call to White House lawyer John Eisenberg, Eisenberg responded by moving the transcript of the call with the president of Ukraine to a classified server.</b> In case you were wondering, that's "a step that other officials have said is at odds with long-standing White House protocol." Eisenberg has now been asked to testify on Monday. Don't put big money on him showing up.

While there are still people lined up for testimony, another source said "Given the evidence we’ve collected so far, we think we’re ready to enter a public phase sooner than later." Here we go.

  yesterday: After a month of closed-door impeachment investigations run by House committees, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced this week that the House <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/28/house-to-vote-on-resolution-establishing-next-steps-in-impeachment-inquiry-000302">would take a formal vote on the impeachment inquiry</a> and the inquiry itself would move into a more public stage. On top of that, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/vindman-offers-a-firsthand-account-of-critical-episodes-in-alleged-quid-pro-quo/2019/10/29/cb16a5c0-fa45-11e9-ac8c-8eced29ca6ef_story.html">Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman became the first person present on the call with Donald Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to testify to House investigators</a>. In just his opening statement he backed up the allegations that the president was demanding "that a foreign government investigate a US citizen." We learned more about his testimony today.
  todays: 
  - item: The biggest news of today was further details from yesterday's testimony by Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman. <b>Citing multiple people familiar with Vindman's testimony, the New York Times reported that "the White House transcript of a July call between President Trump and Ukraine’s president omitted crucial words and phrases."</b> <i>Well then</i>. According to the Times, what was left out of the White House transcript "included Mr Trump's assertion that there were recordings of former Vice President Joseph R Biden Jr discussing Ukraine corruption, and an explicit mention by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, of Burisma Holdings, the energy company whose board employed Mr Biden's son Hunter." <i>Oh.</i> That is certainly an omission. 
    source: New York Times

  - item: In addition to learning more about Vindman's testimony, today featured two State Department officials testifying to House investigators. <b>Catherine Croft and Christopher Anderson, who both served as senior advisors on Ukraine, "described to investigators the unusual intrusion into US foreign policy by Trump-aligned consultants, including his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Robert Livingston, a lobbyist and former GOP congressman,"</b> according to Politico. Robert Livingston? <i>A new player has entered the game.</i> In her opening statement, Croft said that Livingston "characterized Ambassador Yovanovitch as an 'Obama holdover' and associated with George Soros." OK... "It was not clear to me at the time—or now—at whose direction or at whose expense Mr. Livingston was seeking the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch." Well he sounds great.

  - item: A third State Department official also appeared on Capitol Hill today. <b>Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan answered multiple impeachment-y questions during a confirmation hearing to become US ambassador to Russia.</b> While a confirmation hearing for an ambassador is not the normal setting for this type of inquiry, Democrats got right to the point with Sullivan. Did Rudy Giuliani try to smear ousted US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch? "I believe he was, yes." Should the president use the power of his office to get foreign countries to investigate political opponents? "I don't think that would be in accord with our values." Has Sullivan ever "heard of any other president asking a foreign government to investigate an American citizen"? According to reports, Sullivan "can't think of one off the top of my head." And so here we are again—it's remarkable how consistent all this testimony keeps ending up being.

  - item: Speaking of testimony (<i>when aren't we</i>), <b>Democrats have officially asked former National Security Advisor John Bolton to appear in the impeachment inquiry next week</b>. The mustachioed advisor has come up multiple times in testimony over the last month and his appearance before impeachment investigators was all but inevitable. Bolton has been reported to have viewed Rudy Giuliani as a "hand grenade" and refused to get involved in "whatever drug deal" US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland and White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney "are cooking up." That Democrats didn't wait until a judge ruled on whether Bolton's former deputy Charles Kupperman would be compelled to testify (a hearing for which was pushed to Friday), is a sign that they think their hand becomes stronger after tomorrow's floor vote on the impeachment resolution introduced yesterday.

  - item: About the vote tomorrow, <b>Democrats emerged from a caucus meeting today and announced that they expected few defections in the vote on the resolution to begin open impeachment proceedings.</b> According to Politico, only five Democrats "have not come out in support of the impeachment inquiry" and only one, Jeff Van Drew who holds a vulnerable seat in New Jersey has said he's leaning toward no. Despite a few potential no votes from Democrats, "I think most of us recognize transparency and articulation of process is in the best interest of the country and for the institution," said Rep Dean Phillips from Minnesota. No Republicans are expected to vote for the resolution. Shocker, I know.

Testimony scheduled for tomorrow has been moved, and all court proceedings have been bumped back as well. The plate is cleared for a very big day. See you then.

  yesterday: After a month of closed-door testimony investigating the events surrounding President Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky—where it is alleged he held up military aid for Ukraine unless they investigated his political rivals—<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/28/house-to-vote-on-resolution-establishing-next-steps-in-impeachment-inquiry-000302">Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi surprised everyone yesterday with the announcement that she would be introducing a resolution to officially start an impeachment inquiry in the House</a>. So, you know, it was a big day.
  todays: 
  - item: Whoa—we've got an impeachment resolution and a date set for a vote! Now this isn't a vote to impeach the president. Instead the resolution, introduced by Democrats today, sets forward the rules of an official impeachment proceeding—the first step toward likely articles of impeachment. "Following in the footsteps of previous impeachment inquiries," wrote House committee leaders involved in the impeachment inquiry, "the next phase will move from closed depositions to open hearings where the American people will learn firsthand about the president's misconduct." In addition to open hearings, the resolution directs the Intelligence Committee to prepare a report collecting all evidence in the investigation. That report would then be turned over to the Judiciary Committee who would draw up articles of impeachment. There's a long way between here and there though—the resolution will grant Republicans a lot of the things they've asked for, namely being able to issue subpoenas for testimony of their own, and outlines due process rights for the president and his lawyers once the process moves to the Judiciary Committee. A vote on the resolution is set for Halloween—marking the only time that a "<i>do</i> boo, vote" joke could actually sort of work. <i>Sorry not sorry.</i>

  - item: "If you're into the olde-tyme language of official House legalese, you will have a great time working your way through the text of the resolution itself. If you're not, just the remarkably long title is suitably historic: <i>Directing certain committees to continue their ongoing investigations as part of the existing House of Representatives inquiry into whether sufficient grounds exist for the House of Representatives to exercise its Constitutional power to impeach Donald John Trump, President of the United States of America, and for other purposes.</i>"

  - item: The resolution wasn't the only action in the House today, as Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council's top expert on Ukraine, testified to House investigators. The Iraq war vet, who was awarded the Purple Heart after being wounded by an IED, is the first White House official who was actually on the July 25 call between President Trump and Ukrainian president Zelensky to testify to House investigators. His verdict? "I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a US citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the US government's support of Ukraine," he said in his opening statement. "I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained. This would all undermine US national security." Yes, yes it would.

  - item: Meanwhile, the lawsuit filed on Friday by former National Security Council deputy Charles Kupperman—who asked a judge to decide if he should abide by House subpoena or White House demands of non-cooperation—has had a hearing set for the suitably spooky date of October 31. US District Judge Richard Leon said that "due to the time-sensitive nature of the issues raised in this case" he was speeding up the process. A decision in the House's favor would probably mean that they would then call former National Security Advisor John Bolton, who is represented by the same attorney as Kupperman and whose name has come up repeatedly in testimony as someone deeply critical of the president's actions toward Ukraine. Halloween is going to be a hell of a day.

"Delay in this case would not only hinder the House's ability to consider impeachment quickly, but also enhance DOJ's ability to run out the clock on the Committee's impeachment inquiry altogether," wrote House lawyers in their filing.

As Politico reports, Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan is due to be vetted by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday because he's up for a vote to become US ambassador to Russia. <i>What timing.</i> "Senate Democratic aides say Sullivan can expect questions about what role Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, played in shaping Ukraine policy." <i>Ya think?</i> "They'll also want to know what, if anything, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did to rein in Giuliani and other outside actors—as well as Trump—as they sought to pressure Ukraine's government to investigate former vice president Joe Biden." So that should be an interesting wrinkle in an already-interesting day.

  yesterday: Last week was a dramatic one for the impeachment inquiry. We learned about the testimony of Bill Taylor, who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/opening-statement-of-ambassador-william-b-taylor/6b3a6edf-f976-4081-ba7f-bce45468a3ff/">outlined a coordinated, multi-month effort by the White House to pressure Ukraine into investigating Democrats</a>. But also there was the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/23/impeachment-republicans-trump-055688">Republican pizza protest inside a secure facility</a> in the House and Senator Lindsay Graham's <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/24/lindsey-graham-resolution-trump-impeachment-inquiry/4088121002/">Senate resolution</a> condemning the impeachment inquiry. And then on Friday, a federal judge upended all that by <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2019gj0048-46">declaring the House's inquiry to be legal</a> in a larger ruling that also demanded that the House get access to grand jury materials from the Mueller investigation. Got all that?
  todays: 
  - item: The impeachment inquiry is suddenly entering a new phase this week with the surprise announcement this afternoon by Nancy Pelosi that the House will be introducing a resolution—potentially as soon as <i>tomorrow</i>—that will set procedural guidelines for public hearings, subpoenas, and what "due process" for the president will look like. "We are taking this step to eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump Administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas, or continue obstructing the House of Representatives," Speaker Pelosi wrote today. Whether or not it'll accomplish those things is up in the air but either way it is moving fast—a vote is set for <i>Thursday</i>. Hold on to your butts.

  - item: If the expectation by Democrats is that this resolution will hamper the White House's attack line that the impeachment is "illegitimate," well, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham quickly dispelled that by issuing a statement saying that the impeachment inquiry was "completely and irreversibly illegitimate." As if to underline that "irreversible" is the new talking point, Senator Lindsey Graham took to Twitter to declare that "a vote now is a bit like un-ringing a bell." Damned if you don't, damned if you do I guess. Expect to hear this line of "irreversible" criticism a lot in the next 48 hours.

Kupperman had filed a lawsuit on Friday asking for judicial guidance on whether he should follow the White House's demand he not cooperate or the subpoena from the House. Kupperman's lawyer has asked for expedited consideration of the lawsuit, but so far there's no timing set and so Kupperman didn't show up. Complicating things further, Kupperman's lawyer is Charles Cooper who also represents mustachioed former National Security Advisor John Bolton, who Democrats would very much like to talk to but right now they'll be waiting on this judge's decision instead.

  tomorrow: Well, up until Pelosi's announcement of a <i>floor vote on impeachment</i> happening this week, I'd say that the main things to watch would be the three other depositions currently scheduled and the potential of a judicial decision on Kupperman's testimony. But now that there's a floor vote  scheduled for Thursday, I'd assume that this week will get quite a bit wackier. Here we go.
- date: 2019-10-27
  yesterday: Last week the impeachment inquiry was a real roller coaster. It opened with explosive testimony by acting US ambassador to Ukraine Bill Tayor who said he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/opening-statement-of-ambassador-william-b-taylor/6b3a6edf-f976-4081-ba7f-bce45468a3ff/">was witness to a coordinated, multi-month effort to pressure Ukraine into investigating Democrats</a>. After that testimony, Republican House members <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/23/impeachment-republicans-trump-055688">stormed the secured testimony room and ate pizza</a> while Senator Lindsay Graham <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/24/lindsey-graham-resolution-trump-impeachment-inquiry/4088121002/">introduced a Senate resolution</a> condemning the impeachment inquiry, saying it was illegitimate. But then on Friday, a federal judge upended that by <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2019gj0048-46">declaring the House's inquiry to be legal</a> in a larger ruling that also demanded that the House get access to grand jury materials from the Mueller investigation. Somehow that work week was five days long like any other. Which brings us to this weekend.
  todays: 
  - item: House investigative committees were back in session on Saturday, after being closed Thursday and Friday for memorials for Representative Elijah Cummings. Nobody likes working on Saturday—especially Republicans, who wrote a letter of complaint—but State Department acting assistant secretary for Europe, Phillip Reeker, showed up and testified for over eight hours. According to Bloomberg, in his testimony, Reeker said he was "disappointed Secretary of State Michael Pompeo didn’t back the US ambassador to Ukraine when she was targeted in a smear campaign by President Donald Trump and his associates." The closed door testimony was "a much richer reservoir of information than we originally expected," Democratic Rep Stephen Lynch said—for eight hours on a Saturday, I'd sure hope so.

  - item: As the pace of testimony picks up again this week, the White House's blanket refusal to cooperate with the investigation is the focus of a lawsuit filed on Friday by Charles Kupperman. Kupperman, deputy to former national security advisor John Bolton, wants a judge to decide whether he should listen to the White House, who doesn't want him to testify, or comply with the subpoena from the House. "Plaintiff obviously cannot satisfy the competing demands of both the Legislative and Executive Branches," the lawsuit reads, "and he is aware of no controlling judicial authority definitively establishing which Branch’s command should prevail." Obviously this lawsuit has implications far beyond Kupperman, who is scheduled to be deposed tomorrow, and a decision in either direction will have major repercussions moving forward.

And, in a refrain that is both familiar and as yet unenforced, said that failure to show up on Monday "will constitute evidence that may be used against him in a contempt proceeding." But, you know, don't hold your breath—so far House Democrats have yet to enforce a single subpoena.

  - item: Finally, the Washington Post has a revealing look at what Republicans have been asking during all these depositions. Remember, while Republicans have been pushing the narrative this week that they've been locked out of the proceedings, there are 48 Republican members of the three committees leading this stage of the impeachment inquiry. And it turns out their focus has been on—wait for it—unmasking the whistleblower. During testimony, "GOP members and staffers have repeatedly raised the name of a person suspected of filing the whistleblower complaint," the Post reports. Which definitely seems like a normal line of questioning about—<i>checks notes</i>—the president's conduct. Anyway, testimony picks up the pace again this week so expect much more of this to come.

  tomorrow: Things get interesting fast this week, with Charles Kupperman's testimony scheduled for Monday running up against the lawsuit he filed on Friday so, <i>waves hands</i>. After those potential legal fireworks tomorrow, there is testimony scheduled throughout the week, including from White House national security advisor Tim Morrison on Thursday. Morrison's lawyers announced last week he will defy the White House and comply with the subpoena. Strap in. 
- date: 2019-10-25
  yesterday: The last few days of the impeachment inquiry have been dominated by Republicans trying to wrest the narrative away from Democrats. First, House Republicans <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/23/impeachment-republicans-trump-055688">stormed the secure space for testimony and ate pizza</a>, really. Then, yesterday, Senator Lindsay Graham <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/24/lindsey-graham-resolution-trump-impeachment-inquiry/4088121002/">introduced a Senate resolution condemning the impeachment inquiry</a>. Both these actions followed the Tuesday testimony by acting US ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/opening-statement-of-ambassador-william-b-taylor/6b3a6edf-f976-4081-ba7f-bce45468a3ff/">outlined a multi-month effort to pressure Ukraine into investigating the president's political rivals</a>. So there's that. Anyway, that Republican narrative is important as we go into today...
  todays: 
  - item: The Republican talking point that the impeachment inquiry underway in the House is "illegitimate" was dealt a significant blow today after dominating the narrative this week. In a ruling related to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election (more on that in a second), federal judge Beryl A Howell found that Department of Justice arguments that the House needed to pass a resolution authorizing a formal impeachment proceeding was "cherry-picked and incomplete." The US District Court judge went on to say "more significantly, this test has no textual support in the US Constitution." Judge Howell goes on to cite cases of non-presidential impeachment inquiries in the House that proceeded without a House resolution but, she adds "even in cases of presidential impeachment, a House resolution has never, in fact, been required to begin an impeachment inquiry." <i>Well then.</i>

  - item: Believe it or not, declaring the impeachment inquiry legal was only a side quest in Judge Howell's decision. The rest was a big deal too, seeing as how she ordered that the Department of Justice turn over certain grand jury materials from Robert Mueller's investigation to the House Judiciary Committee—<i>by Wednesday</i>. The Judiciary Committee had sued this summer to release the redacted portions of Mueller's final report along with grand jury materials cited in the report. The grand jury material, usually secret, should be made available to House investigators because the "House was legally engaged in a judicial process that exempts Congress from normal grand jury secrecy rules," the Washington Post reported. Even if the impeachment inquiry remains focused on Ukraine, one would expect that grand jury material regarding Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort's work in Ukraine would be of interest. House investigators would get those on Wednesday, barring a DOJ appeal to the Supreme Court, which, <i>stares at you, eyebrows raised</i>.

  - item: All of this may complicate the job of the person at the White House in charge of counter-messaging the impeachment inquiry—that is, if they had one. Politico today looks at the search for a "communications guru" to handle point on the impeachment at the White House. "They are trying to figure out how to set up a war room, without it being a war room and without it devolving into a civil war inside the White House," Politico reported. Well, it's good to know what you want. And also that it's what you don't want. And also that it might kick off a civil war. Sounds reasonable.

  - item: Speaking of the White House, lawyers for Tim Morrison, a National Security Council advisor on Russia and Europe, announced today that he would testify to House investigative committees next week. Morrison's testimony would be the first from someone that actually listened in on the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian president Zelensky. Despite Morrison's White House role—and the White House's blanket refusal to cooperate with the inquiry—Morrison's lawyer says he will testify. "He's going to answer questions. That's where we're at right now," his lawyer told CNN. "We haven't made final decisions on anything other than he'll appear with the subpoena." Morrison will testify next Thursday and will be one of at least four officials testifying next week as the House gets back to business after pausing Thursday and Friday for Elijah Cummings' memorial services.

  - item: Last, <i>but certainly not least</i>, Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, butt dialed a reporter from NBC late last night. <i>Catches breath</i>. The call, which came in after 11pm, went to voice mail. Over the three minute message, "Giuliani can be heard discussing overseas dealings and lamenting the need for cash, though it's difficult to discern the full context of the conversation." Back up a second—<i>the need for cash??</i> "The problem is we need some money," Giuliani is overheard saying to an unidentified second person. After an extended silence from both people, he follows up with "We need a few hundred thousand." <i>Oh</i>. It's worth noting that <i>before he was the president's personal lawyer</i>, Guiliani served as cybersecurity advisor to Trump and, more recently, was paid a half-million dollars by Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman's company Fraud Guarantee (<i>stares</i>) for cybersecurity consulting. But he's butt dialing reporters late at night because that is a totally normal and chill thing that all cybersecurity experts/lawyers to the president definitely do. <i>Help me</i>.

You know, like happens. 
  todays: 
  - item: Following yesterday's pizza party/raid on the secure facility, Republicans continued to assail the impeachment process today. This time it was Senate Republican Lindsay Graham picking up the mantle by introducing a resolution condemning the impeachment inquiry. The resolution calls on the House to hold a formal vote on opening an impeachment inquiry. In a press conference that accompanied the introduction of the resolution, Graham said that "I'm not here to tell you that Donald Trump has done nothing wrong," but that he deserves the same rights "as Clinton and Nixon." I've heard fuller-throated endorsements in my time, but OK. The resolution is not yet scheduled for a vote in the Senate.

  - item: Speaking of yesterday's Republican occupation of the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) in the basement of the House, Phillip Bump of the Washington Post has an interesting breakdown of the numbers of the protest, including that more than a quarter of the Republicans that staged the action yesterday were already on the committees running this part of the impeachment inquiry—meaning they already had full access to everything happening in the hearings. On the other hand, there <i>was</i> pizza.

  - item: House Republicans—whose pizza party (I'm not getting over it, <i>sorry</i>) delayed testimony by over five hours—weren't the only ones attempting to block yesterday's testimony of Laura Cooper, deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia. Far more serious was the letter written by the Department of Defense to Cooper's lawyers prior to her testimony that warned her against testifying. The New York Times got ahold of the letter and annotates it fully. It's a good look into how the administration attempts to pressure people to not testify. After receiving a subpoena from the House, Cooper testified. "The letter leaves ambiguous whether such actions would be insubordinate."

  - item: "Meanwhile, we're learning a little more about Cooper's deposition. The testimony, which lasted three hours, is expected to 'fill in details of an explosive aspect of Democrats' impeachment inquiry: whether Trump withheld nearly $400 million in military aid for Ukraine to pressure the ally’s new president.' While Democrats present at the testimony didn't give further details, Republican Mark Meadows—you know one of the 48 Republicans with access—said that 'elements of her testimony conflicted' with the Tuesday testimony of William Taylor."

  - item: Another Republican that has full access to the impeachment inquiry, Jim Jordan, wrote a letter today to State Department official Phillip Reeker today, complaining that his deposition was rescheduled to this Saturday and he'd like it moved to a different day. His main issue? He doesn't want to have to come in on a Saturday. On one hand, that's very relatable, but on the other, <i>waves hands in all directions</i>.

  - item: Finally, regular business was halted at the House for the next two days to accommodate memorials for Representative Elijah Cummings, whose death last week cast a long shadow over this week's impeachment proceedings. Today, Cummings "became the first African American lawmaker to lie in state in the Capitol, an honor bestowed to only a few dozen statesmen, presidents and military leaders throughout US history." RIP.

  tomorrow: With the House closed again tomorrow, no new testimony will be heard until Reeker's deposition on Saturday. However, rescheduled testimony is getting lined up for next week alongside new witnesses as well. And of course, expect the theme of "Republicans fighting back" to continue tomorrow despite the funeral. And who knows, maybe more pizza (sorry, not sorry).

  yesterday: Yesterday all eyes were on the testimony of acting US ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor. Taylor's testimony, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/us/trump-impeachment-ukraine.html">which drew from extensive notes</a> from conversations he had with many people wrapped up in the impeachment inquiry, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/opening-statement-of-ambassador-william-b-taylor/6b3a6edf-f976-4081-ba7f-bce45468a3ff/">outlined a months-long, coordinated process</a> by members of the White House, the State Department, and Rudy Giuliani, to pressure Ukraine to investigate Democrats in return for military aid. The explosive testimony set up what looked to be a tense day on Capitol Hill. Well, we didn't know the half of it.
  todays: 
  - item: Chaos reigned at the impeachment proceedings today, as House Republicans stormed the secure room House investigative committees were using for depositions. <i>No, really</i>. According to Politico, "GOP lawmakers who do not sit on the three committees leading the inquiry initially refused to leave the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) in the basement of the Capitol, prompting a standoff with Democrats that ultimately led the House’s sergeant-at-arms to intervene." They even ordered pizza while they occupied the room. <i>Stares right at the camera.</i> In addition to the occupation and the pizza, many of the lawmakers entered the secure room with cell phones, which is strictly forbidden what with it <i>being a secure room in the basement of the United States Capitol Building</i>. I mean, <i>come on now</i>. The protest was in retaliation for what Republicans feel is an unfair closed door proceeding—even though the 48 Republicans on the three investigating committees have full access to the depositions and their lawyers have equal time to question witnesses, so like, shruggie emoji, I got nothing. Do your thing guys, I guess.

In a meeting at the White House yesterday with 30 House Republicans, the plan to make a run at the SCIF was devised. "During a nearly two-hour meeting, which focused mostly on the impeachment inquiry, lawmakers shared their plans to storm into the secure room." Sure, why not.

  - item: The "mechanics" of that blocked aid to Ukraine was the focus of a New York Times investigation today which revealed that "Ukraine was aware the White House was holding up the funds weeks earlier than United States and Ukrainian officials had acknowledged." The White House has maintained that the Ukrainians didn't know aid had been withheld, and thusly they could not have been pressured into making a deal to release it. But the Times reports that "word of the aid freeze had gotten to high-level Ukrainian officials by the first week in August," so probably someone's got some explaining to do.

  yesterday: This week got started with a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/21/acting-head-of-omb-refuses-to-testify-in-house-impeachment-probe-053256">shuffling of the calendar</a> to accommodate memorials for Rep Elijah Cummings, <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/features/bs-fe-elijah-cummings-mentorship-20191017-ars4uy3d5reovmaljtb5drnvxm-story.html">whose unexpected death last week</a>, and his role as the chair of the House Oversight Committee, continues to have ripple effects on the impeachment inquiry. As a result, only two testimonies are currently scheduled. However, today's was a big one so let's just get right to it.
  todays:  
  - item: William Taylor, the US chargé d'affaires (the fancy term for "acting ambassador") for Ukraine testified to House investigative committees today over the protest of the State Department, who attempted to block his testimony this morning. Working from extensive notes, Taylor is reported to have "sketched out in remarkable detail a quid-pro-quo pressure campaign on Ukraine that Mr Trump and his allies have long denied, one in which the president conditioned the entire United States relationship with Ukraine on a promise that the country would investigate former Vice President Joseph R Biden Jr and his family, along with other Democrats." Taylor's testimony⁠—which we will almost certainly learn more about in the coming days⁠—directly contradicts the president's assertion that there was "no quid pro quo" between US aid and political investigations by Ukraine. In actuality, according to the New York Times the testimony drew a "direct line" between foreign aid and Trump's political aims. 
    source: New York Times
    url: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/us/trump-impeachment-ukraine.html
  - item: While we don't know much about the substance of Taylor's testimony yet, his 15 page opening statement has leaked and it paints a very clear picture of a months-long campaign involving EU ambassador Gordon Sondland, US special representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker (both of whom have already testified to House committees), and Rudy Giuliani to get Ukraine to capitulate to President Trump's demands in return for military aid. The statement, which paints a timeline stretching back to Ukrainian president Zelensky's election, describes a "weird combination of encouraging, confusing, and ultimately alarming circumstances." The timeline is detailed, damning, and worth reading in all of its PDF-y goodness.

  - item: Speaking of Kurt Volker, US special envoy to Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal today reports on a meeting between Volker and Ukrainian president Zelensky in Toronto on July second, weeks before Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky. Volker "pulled Mr. Zelensky aside at a conference in Toronto on July 2 to urge him to make clear his commitment to investigating corruption and alleged 2016 election interference," you know, like you do in secret at a conference. This report, along with Taylor's opening statement, certainly stretches the timeline far out from Trump's "perfect" call with the Ukrainian president in late July.

  - item: 'Meanwhile, this morning Donald Trump lashed out at the impeachment proceedings saying "all Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here—a lynching." <i>Stares.</i> As you... <i>Stares again</i>. As you might expect, this particular line of ahistorical attack did not go over well with almost anyone, prompting rare condemnation even from Republicans. "Given the history of this in our country, I would not compare it to a lynching,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. "That was an unfortunate choice of words." Democratic Representative Danny Davis was far more blunt in his assessment: "What the hell is wrong with you?" he asked. "Do you know how many people who look like me have been lynched, since the inception of this country, by people who look like you. Delete this tweet."'

  - item: Finally, the New York Times reported last night that House Democrats have extended their timeline for impeachment proceedings—now expected to stretch to at least the end of the year. Why? Well, "after a complicated web of damaging revelations about the president has emerged from private depositions unfolding behind closed doors, Democratic leaders have now begun plotting a full-scale—and probably more time-consuming—effort to lay out their case in a set of high-profile public hearings on Capitol Hill." So I guess we'll be together for a while longer still. I work for tips. Lololol. <i>Cries</i>.

    url: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/21/us/trump-impeachment-democrats.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage
  tomorrow: Due to yesterday's announcement that the House will be closed for regular business Thursday and Friday to memorialize Rep Elijah Cummings, tomorrow is the last "real" day of the impeachment inquiry and features the testimony of DOD official Laura Cooper. We'll probably learn more about both Taylor and Cooper's testimonies in the days ahead, which should definitely prompt very chill responses from the president I am sure. 
- date: 2019-10-21
  yesterday: Last week ended with White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/us/politics/mick-mulvaney-trump-ukraine.html">admitting at a press conference</a> that President Trump had linked Ukrainian military aid with investigating his political rivals. Unsurprisingly that statement was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/mulvaney-acknowledges-trump-held-ukraine-aid-political-reasons-get-over-n1068256">rapidly retracted</a> but has proven to have <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/18/mick-mulvaney-press-briefing-050855">staying power</a>. Mulvaney's statement followed a productive week of testimony in the house that further revealed the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/17/gordon-sondland-to-break-from-trump-in-impeachment-testimony-000288">depth of Rudy Giuliani's role</a> in Ukrainian affairs. Finally, on a solemn note, the week also ended with the <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/features/bs-fe-elijah-cummings-mentorship-20191017-ars4uy3d5reovmaljtb5drnvxm-story.html">unexpected passing</a> of Rep Elijah Cummings. It was a very full week.  
  todays: 
  - item: This week began with a shuffling of the agenda. While House investigators had planned for testimony of upwards of <i>nine</i> officials over the next five days, but plans have changed to accommodate memorials following the death last week of House Oversight Committee Chair Rep Elijah Cummings. Cummings will lie in state in the Capitol on Thursday with a funeral service on Friday. As a result, many depositions have been postponed. However, House investigative committees are still expected to hear from William Taylor, acting ambassador to Ukraine, and Laura Cooper, who oversees Ukraine and Russia issues at the Department of Defense on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively. Taylor—who in text messages released a few weeks ago, said it was "crazy" to link Ukraine aide to political investigations—is the testimony to watch this week, even before the schedule was trimmed.

  - item: Two other officials that were slated to testify this week made the House's reshuffling a bit easier, if we're defining "easier" as "defying subpoenas." Acting head of the Office of Management and Budget Russ Vought took to Twitter today to declare "I saw some Fake News over the weekend to correct. As the WH letter made clear two weeks ago, OMB officials--myself and Mike Duffey--will not be complying with deposition requests this week." He closed with the hashtag "shamprocess" Which I read as "Shamp Rocess" twice before I got it.

  - item: In case you were worried that maybe nothing was getting done in the House today, you'll be glad to know that House Republicans are working to force a vote censuring House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff tonight. The resolution, introduced by Arizona Republican Andy Biggs, says that Schiff "manufactured a false retelling" of the President's call with Ukrainian president Zelensky. The resolution goes on to say that Schiff's actions "make a mockery of the impeachment process, one of this chamber’s most solemn constitutional duties." Which OK, sure guy, that's definitely the thing making a mockery of the process glad you're on it.

  - item: Meanwhile, Donald Trump talked to press at a cabinet meeting today, where he claimed the House is "interviewing ambassadors who I’d never heard of." House investigators have talked with the current ambassador to the European Union, the former ambassador to Ukraine, and tomorrow will talk with the current acting ambassador to Ukraine. One would expect that Trump knows who these people are and yet, "I don’t know who these people are. I never heard of them." <i>I'm exhausted</i>.

  - item: And finally in the same cabinet meeting, President Trump once again attacked the whistleblower who kicked off the impeachment investigation nearly a month ago. Those attacks caused Senator Chuck Schumer to ask "both the acting director of national intelligence and the inspector general on Monday afternoon to outline what 'specific steps' they are taking to protect the whistleblower" in case the president or others identify them. Which is normal and chill for sure.

  tomorrow: With the change of schedule in the House, there are far less depositions happening, but William "it's crazy to withhold security assistance" Taylor's testimony tomorrow should be well worth watching out for (if it leaks) and Laura Cooper later in the week should shed more light on the holdback of Ukrainian military aid this summer. Beyond that, what had been gearing up to be a wild week may end up more subdued. Ahaahahaa who am I kidding crying emoji.

  yesterday: Week four of the impeachment inquiry took a weird turn on Thursday. The week saw a steady drumbeat of testimony in the House that filled out our understanding of who (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trumps-former-top-russia-adviser-to-testify-in-house-impeachment-probe/2019/10/14/e6015c1c-ee34-11e9-8693-f487e46784aa_story.html">Rudy</a>) was deeply involved in running US-Ukrainian policy (yep, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/17/gordon-sondland-to-break-from-trump-in-impeachment-testimony-000288">pretty much all Rudy</a>) that was matched by a steady drumbeat of <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/white-house-budget-office-defies-house-impeachment-subpoena-for-ukraine-documents">denying</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/defense-secretary-mark-esper-will-no-longer-comply-impeachment-inquiry-n1067226?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_np">subpoenas</a> by the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/pence-refuses-house-request-provide-documents-related-ukraine-call-n1066651">White House</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/RudyGiuliani/status/1184204275267854338">and others</a>. That would have been that until Mick Mulvaney, White House Chief of Staff, held a press conference on Thursday where he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/us/politics/mick-mulvaney-trump-ukraine.html">casually confirmed that Ukrainian aid was tied to cooperation with the president's investigation of Democrats</a>. You know, like you do. He's been walking it back ever since. 
  todays: 
  - item: Details from the last week of testimony continues to leak out. On Saturday we learned that George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, told House investigators that Rudy Giuliani pushed the State Department to issue a visa to former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin. Shokin was forced out of his job in 2016 due to massive corruption, but Giuliani wanted to interview him about, guess what, the Democrats. When State denied the visa, Kent testified, Giuliani "then appealed to the White House to have State reverse its decision." Remarkably, they didn't.

  - item: Additional reverberations from last week hit yesterday when Republican Representative Francis Rooney—who <i>just Friday</i> was critical of White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney's Thursday press conference saying Mulvaney "basically said it was a quid pro quo" and that he wouldn't rule out voting for impeachment—suddenly announced Saturday he was retiring in 2020. Wait, <i>what</i>? Uh. I got nothing.

  - item: The field of Republicans willing to speak up about impeachment is not particularly large (it's less a field and more a patch of sod), but John Kasich, the—<i>checks notes</i>—former Governor of Ohio, joined that small group yesterday. "If you are asking me if I was sitting in the House of Representatives today and you were to ask me how do I feel, do I think impeachment should move forward and should go for a full examination and a trial in the United States Senate, my vote would be yes," he told CNN. Any port in a storm I guess.

  - item: Finally, Mick Mulvaney attempted once again to walk back his disastrous press conference. Sunday morning he joined the friendly confines of Fox News Sunday to further clarify. In a rambling answer he admitted once again that "the president did mention to me from time to time about the DNC server, he mentioned the DNC server to other people publically, he even mentioned it to president Zelensky in the phone call," before adding that "it wasn't connected to the aid" to Ukraine. K Mick, thanks for clearing that right up.

  tomorrow: It's going to be a potentially very busy week in the House, with currently <i>nine</i> testimonies or depositions scheduled. Considering the White House's stance of non-cooperation, we'll see how many of those actually happen but just for context that's twice as many as happened this past week so I hope you are strapped in. 
- date: 2019-10-18
  yesterday: Yesterday was one of the wilder days since the impeachment inquiry kicked off. Between Mick Mulvaney admitting that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/us/politics/mick-mulvaney-trump-ukraine.html">president held up aid</a> to Ukraine in return for political favors, US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland saying that <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/17/gordon-sondland-to-break-from-trump-in-impeachment-testimony-000288">he was directed</a> to run Ukraine policy through Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, and Energy Secretary Rick Perry <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/rick-perry-called-rudy-giuliani-at-trumps-direction-on-ukraine-concerns-11571273635?redirect=amp#click=https://t.co/sIxFA6eT4Z">saying the same thing</a>, you would think that today would be off like a shot. Well... 
  todays: 
  - item: The reverberations of yesterday's press conference with White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney⁠—where he admitted to linking military aid for Ukraine with Ukraine investigating Democrats (and that people should "get over it")⁠—continued to ripple out. While Donald Trump has so far stood by his chief of staff, his go-to conservative pundit Sean Hannity told his radio listeners "I just think he’s dumb, I really do." On Capitol Hill, even a few Republican lawmakers spoke out. "You don’t hold up foreign aid that we had previously appropriated for a political initiative. Period," said Senator Lisa Murkowski. Rep Francis Rooney of Florida was even more outspoken, saying that Mulvaney "basically said it was a quid pro quo," adding "it’s not an etch a sketch, it's kind of hard to argue that he didn't say it, right?" Yep, you're definitely right about that.

  - item: But Republican leadership continues to hold the line despite Mulvaney's admissions yesterday. In a press conference today, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy came to his defense saying "I think Mick Mulvaney clarified his statement to be very clear. I take Mick Mulvaney at his word for clarification." Which I mean, OK you do you man.

  - item: Meanwhile in the House, after four days in a row of depositions, most impeachment work took a breather today after Laura Cooper, a deputy at the Pentagon, rescheduled her deposition late Thursday night. Cooper, who is the deputy assistant secretary for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, is now expected to testify October 24. She joins an already-full calendar with five testimonies scheduled for next week.

  - item: And to wrap up the week with what has been the White House's ongoing theme, outgoing Energy Secretary Rick Perry today told House investigative committees that he won't comply with a subpoena for documents that had a deadline for today. Democrats had sought documents pertaining to Perry's involvement in Ukraine but, nope, the Energy Department is "unable to comply with your request for documents and communications at this time." Democrats might want to figure out a strategy for enforcing subpoenas but I'm not holding my breath at this point.

  tomorrow: Well if today ended up being what qualifies for "chill" around here, then certainly that'll just ride out through the weekend right? Please? Five testimonies are set for next week, plus document deadlines, and maybe the Democrats will enforce a subpoena I think I close out every week with that last one <i>wheee</i>. Weekend!

  yesterday: A week of closed-door testimony by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/us/mckinley-impeachment-ukraine.html">State Department officials</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/14/us/politics/bolton-giuliani-fiona-hill-testimony.html#click=https://t.co/rTwBWk6HUI">National Security aides</a> has given a broader understanding of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/us/politics/gordon-sondland-intelligence-risk.html">pressure exerted on diplomats</a> by the White House and the president's personal lawyer, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trumps-former-top-russia-adviser-to-testify-in-house-impeachment-probe/2019/10/14/e6015c1c-ee34-11e9-8693-f487e46784aa_story.html">Rudy Giuliani</a>. At the same time, the White House has <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/defense-secretary-mark-esper-will-no-longer-comply-impeachment-inquiry-n1067226?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_np">continued</a> to <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/white-house-budget-office-defies-house-impeachment-subpoena-for-ukraine-documents">blockade documents</a> from being turned over to investigators. It's been a tense week. And then today happened. 
  todays: 
  - item: Today opened with the somber news of the death of Representative Elijah Cummings. Cummings has played a key role in the impeachment inquiry as the chair of the House Oversight Committee. But more than that, he represented his west Baltimore district for over two decades, earning the respect of those he worked with and represented. "I don’t expect to change the world," he said when he won his first race for the Maryland House of Delegates in 1983 (he moved to the US House in 1996). “I’m just ready to get to work." He did the work.

  - item: The sober news of the morning, however, was quickly replaced by one of the wilder moments since the impeachment inquiry kicked off just over three weeks ago. White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney held a press conference to announce that next year's G7 summit, a yearly meeting of world leaders, will be held at the Trump Doral golf club in Miami (<i>stares directly into camera</i>). You would think that would be the update, but in fact the update is that at the presser, Mulvaney was asked about the president's call with Ukraine and the connection between investigating the Democrats and the withholding of $400 million in military aid to the country. Did the president "mention to me in passing the corruption related to the DNC server?" Mulvaney asked rhetorically. "Absolutely. No question about that." Then he added "and that's why we held up the money." When asked, point blank, if this was a quid-pro-quo, he responded "We do that all the time," later telling reporters to "get over it. There's going to be political influence in foreign policy." <i>Help. Me. I. Am. Dying. Inside.</i>

  - item: Would it surprise you to learn that Mulvaney is now trying to walk those statements back? No, no it wouldn't, would it. Mulvaney is now trying to walk those statements back. "The president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server," he wrote a few hours later. OK Mick thanks for clearing that up.

  - item: Given the relentless nature of today's news cycle, it's easy to forget that US ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland, testified to House investigative committees today. Considering what a central figure he has emerged as over the last few days of testimony and the role he played in last week's White House blockade of the inquiry, it's remarkable that he's not the biggest story of the day. In his opening statements, which have leaked, Sondland testified he was directed by the president to involve Rudy Giuliani in Ukrainian affairs. It was only "much later" that he realized "Mr. Giuliani’s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son or to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the President's 2020 reelection campaign." Somehow this is not the most remarkable thing that a person said today by a mile.

  - item: Sondland isn't the only person today saying that the president told them to call Rudy Giuliani about Ukraine. Rick Perry, who tonight officially announced he is resigning as Energy Secretary, told the Wall Street Journal that he was directed by Trump this spring to get on the phone with Giuliani. On the call, according to the Journal, Giuliani "blamed Ukraine for the dossier about Mr. Trump's alleged ties to Russia that was created by a former British intelligence officer and asserted that Ukraine had Mrs. Clinton's email server and 'dreamed up' evidence that helped send former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to jail." <i>Gestures wildly in every direction.</i>

  tomorrow: Somehow, impossibly, there is another day in the work week. The White House has a deadline to turn over documents to House investigators tomorrow, so that should go real legal and real cool. And probably 10,000 other things will happen. <i>Whelp.</i>
- date: 2019-10-16
  yesterday: House investigators have kept busy in the fourth week of the impeachment inquiry, keeping up a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/14/us/politics/who-is-fiona-hill.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage">daily pace</a> of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/us/politics/impeachment-george-kent-state.html#click=https://t.co/KvMLoN2AoY">closed-door testimony</a>. The White House has continued to resist the inquiry this week, with <a href="https://twitter.com/RudyGiuliani/status/1184204275267854338">multiple people</a> defying subpoenas to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/pence-refuses-house-request-provide-documents-related-ukraine-call-n1066651">turn over documents</a>. These two themes of testimony and defiance are going to continue in parallel all week. Maybe all time. To infinity and beyond. 
  todays: 
  - item: 'The week of testimony continued in the House today with investigating committees hearing from Michael McKinley, former senior advisor to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. McKinley abruptly quit his position last week. "The timing of my resignation was the result of two overriding concerns: the failure, in my view, of the State Department to offer support to foreign service employees caught up in the impeachment inquiry on Ukraine," McKinley is reported to have said in his opening statement, "and, second, by what appears to be the utilization of our ambassadors overseas to advance a domestic political objective."'

  - item: Even as more people are called to testify in the House, we're continuing to learn details about Monday's ten hour testimony by National Security Counsel senior official Fiona Hill. In the latest information to leak, Hill described Gordon Sondland, US ambassador to the EU as "a potential national security risk because he was so unprepared for his job" and that he was "metaphorically driving in an unfamiliar place with no guardrails and no GPS." Guess who is scheduled to testify to the House tomorrow? Gordon Sondland. So that's gonna be something.

  - item: "While testimony has been going (relatively) smoothly this week, the White House blockade on documents has continued. Yesterday Defense Secretary Mark Esper refused to turn over subpoenaed documents pertaining to the Ukrainian aide package that was held back at the president's direction this summer. In refusing, Esper cited the refrain that we've heard repeatedly this week: that the inquiry is illegitimate because the House has not voted to authorize it."

  - item: The Defense Secretary's refusal wasn't the only one from yesterday. In addition to no documents from VP Mike Pence and Rudy Giuliani (which were covered in yesterday's update), the Office of Management and Budget was also supposed to produce documents pertaining to Ukrainian aid and they too refused, citing the same old refrain. At some point, one would imagine that Democrats will enforce these subpoenas. But then again, one can imagine lots of things.

The same guy! And guess who has a subpoena deadline tomorrow to turn over White House documents? The same guy again! Anyway, speaking of that guy, the Washington Post today pegs him as a key facilitator of the July 25 call, including tricking National Security Advisor John Bolton into thinking he was giving a solo briefing to Trump before the Ukraine call when actually Trump immediately followed the Bolton call with a secret briefing by Gordon Sondland (there's that name again) because why not."

He was scheduled last week too and was blocked by the White House, but his lawyers triple swear he'll be there tomorrow. There's also the question of the subpoena to Mick Mulvaney for White House documents, but I think we know how that one's going to turn out. Somehow tomorrow is only Thursday.

  yesterday: Week four of the impeachment inquiry started yesterday with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/14/us/politics/who-is-fiona-hill.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage">testimony of Fiona Hill</a>, a former NSC senior official for Russia and Europe. Hill's testimony was the first of a full week of testimony scheduled in the House. This is in stark contrast to last week's impeachment news which largely centered around the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/08/white-house-formally-tells-democrats-it-wont-cooperate-with-impeachment-probe-000279">White House's refusal to cooperate</a> (and the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/two-foreign-born-men-who-helped-giuliani-on-ukraine-arrested-on-campaign-finance-charges-11570714188?mod=hp_lead_pos1">arrest of Rudy Giuliani's associates</a>, which is quite a thing to stuff in a parenthetical I know). Anyway, people are cooperating and we're learning... things. Let's get to it.  
  todays: 
  - item: We learned quite a bit more about National Security Counsel senior official Fiona Hill's testimony late last night and this morning. Hill, who spent <i>ten hours</i> testifying on the Hill yesterday, said that Rudy Giuliani "ran a shadow foreign policy in Ukraine that circumvented US officials and career diplomats." And that John Bolton, National Security Advisor, told her to raise her concerns with White House lawyers. Wanna guess how that went?

  - item: Hill's testimony about John Bolton was eyebrow-raising enough that it warrants its own bullet point. Hill testified that Bolton told her that he didn't want to have any part of "whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up," and that Giuliani was "a hand grenade who’s going to blow everybody up." One would expect a subpoena may be heading Bolton's way soon.

  - item: Hill was the first of an entire week of testimony scheduled at the House. Today saw State Department Ukraine policy head George Kent testify. Arriving at the hearing in a bow tie, it is expected that Kent would expand on leaked State Department emails he authored that warned about Giuliani's work in Ukraine and that attempts to smear former US ambassador to Ukraine Maria Yovanovitch were "complete poppycock," which is an adorable way to put it.

  - item: Speaking of Rudy Giuliani, today was his deadline to turn over documents to House investigative committees. Surprise! He refused. In a letter authored by lawyer Jon Sale, he called the impeachment inquiry "unconstitutional" and said that the request was "beyond the scope of a legitimate inquiry." Despite the letter being written by a lawyer, in a tweet that accompanied the letter Giuliani himself said, "I do not need a lawyer." Which, <i>waves hands in all directions</i>, OK let's just go with it.

    url: https://twitter.com/RudyGiuliani/status/1184204275267854338
  - item: And in other refusing-to-produce-documents news, shortly after Giuliani posted his refusal (which was to a subpoena) VP Mike Pence followed suit and also refused to produce documents (which were requested, but not subpoenaed). In wording that echoed Giuliani's, Pence's refusal called into question the legitimacy of the inquiry. "Never before in history has the Speaker of the House attempted to launch an 'impeachment inquiry' against a president without the majority of the House of Representatives voting to authorize a constitutionally acceptable process." Mike Pence, it should be noted, has a lawyer.

  - item: And finally, speaking of the Speaker of the House, today Nancy Pelosi held a meeting with House Democrats to discuss the possibility of holding a vote on the impeachment inquiry--the lack of which is the basis of Republican criticisms of legitimacy. But in a press conference happening literally as I write this update, Pelosi and Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff said that they would not hold a vote yet.

  tomorrow: There's more testimony and more document deadlines to come. Tomorrow, arrested Giuliani aides Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman are supposed to supply documents to the House, while Thursday is the deadline for the White House to produce documents. Don't place any big money bets on those coming through. Also tomorrow, Michael McKinley, senior advisor to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who abruptly resigned last week, is set to testify. And Thursday, Gordon Sondland, US ambassador to the EU who was blocked from testifying by the White House last week, is scheduled to appear in the House. Folks, it's going to get more nuts. Sorry. 
- date: 2019-10-14
  yesterday: The last week of the impeachment inquiry was a wild one, with the White House <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/08/white-house-formally-tells-democrats-it-wont-cooperate-with-impeachment-probe-000279">calling the inquiry "illegitimate"</a> and refusing to take part, while Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer whose actions in Ukraine are at the center of the inquiry, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/two-foreign-born-men-who-helped-giuliani-on-ukraine-arrested-on-campaign-finance-charges-11570714188?mod=hp_lead_pos1">saw associates arrested on charges related to work in Ukraine</a>. It was a lot. Honestly, this week may be even more. Anyway, welcome to week four of the impeachment inquiry! We'll get through this together.
  todays: 
  - item: Today President Trump's former top advisor on Russia and Europe, Fiona Hill, gave testimony behind closed doors to House committees. Hill, who resigned her position at the National Security Council this summer, was expected to testify "that she and other officials objected strenuously to the removal of the ambassador to Ukraine, only to be disregarded" as well as be questioned about Rudy Giuliani's presence in Ukraine. Hill was the first person from the White House to give a deposition since the White House's letter last week refusing to cooperate with the investigation, and it does not appear that they attempted to block her testimony. She had no opening statement and no part of her testimony has yet to leak or be released, so we're just gonna have to be patient here.

  - item: After reports about Schiff's concern for the whisteblower's safety surfaced, President Trump took to Twitter this morning to demand that the whistleblower be identified. "We must determine the Whistleblower’s identity to determine WHY this was done to the USA," the President tweeted. Please note that the Whistleblower Protection Act explicitly exists for this reason. Anyway, later he tweeted that people should watch Dancing with the Stars, so here we are.

  tomorrow: Today's testimony is just the tip of the iceberg for the week. In addition to a slew of deadlines (many of which are <i>tomorrow</i>) for documents by the White House, Rudy Giuliani, his arrested associates and others, there will also be testimony by numerous State Department officials, including US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland who last week was blocked from testifying by the White House. Hold on to your butts. 
- date: 2019-10-13
  yesterday: Week three of the impeachment inquiry was a real roller coaster, starting with the White House <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/10/08/768200323/trump-administration-blocks-ambassadors-testimony-a-key-witness-in-ukraine-scand">blocking the testimony</a> of the US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland and issuing a letter calling the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/08/white-house-formally-tells-democrats-it-wont-cooperate-with-impeachment-probe-000279">entire inquiry "illegitimate"</a> and ending with associates of the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/two-foreign-born-men-who-helped-giuliani-on-ukraine-arrested-on-campaign-finance-charges-11570714188?mod=hp_lead_pos1">arrested on federal charges</a> relating to work in Ukraine. Plus, a whole lot else. It was quite a week. Thank goodness nothing happens on the weekend. Oh, wait.
  todays: 
  - item: Late Friday, news broke that Rudy Giuliani is under federal investigation. Considering that two associates of his were  arrested last week and that Giuliani's dealings in Ukraine are swirling at the center of the impeachment inquiry, it's perhaps not that surprising. But still, as the New York Times points out, "it is also a stark turn for Mr Giuliani, who now finds himself under scrutiny from the same United States attorney’s office he led in the 1980s."

  - item: The no-good-very-bad news week for Rudy Giuliani seemed to come to an ignoble end Friday when Trump said he "didn't know" if Giuliani was still his lawyer, but Trump sent out a series of encouraging tweets en route to his golf course Saturday morning, where he met Giuliani for lunch. So I guess that answers that, for now at least. 
    source: New York Times
    url: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/us/politics/trump-giuliani-lunch.html
  - item: Meanwhile, the week ended with a new understanding of the White House's letter that called the impeachment inquiry "illegitimate." While the letter was signed by White House counsel Pat Cipollone, a new report suggests that the letter was largely written by President Trump. According to the Daily Beast, "sources said that Trump enthusiastically suggested adding various jabs at Democratic lawmakers and would request that their 'unfair' treatment of him be incorporated into the letter." Sure, why not.

  - item: And, finally, in another "but wait, there's more" from last week, the same day that the White House letter dropped, US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland was blocked from testifying. As the week ended, his lawyers said that his testimony was back on and now, according to the Washington Post, he's going to testify that his text saying that there was "no quid pro quo" with Ukraine was also written under the president's direction. "It’s only true that the president said it, not that it was the truth," he's planning to explain. Help.

  tomorrow: The theme of the coming week is "deadlines." October 15 is the deadline for documents to be produced by Rudy Giuliani, VP Pence, the Office of Budget and Management, and the Department of Defense and the White House has a deadline to produce documents by October 18. Plus, Sondland is scheduled to testify on Thursday. I'm sure this will all go exactly as planned. 
- date: 2019-10-11
  yesterday: Week three of the impeachment inquiry kicked up more than a few notches this week. First, the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/08/white-house-formally-tells-democrats-it-wont-cooperate-with-impeachment-probe-000279">White House declared</a> the inquiry "illegitimate" and refused to cooperate. And then, associates of the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/two-foreign-born-men-who-helped-giuliani-on-ukraine-arrested-on-campaign-finance-charges-11570714188?mod=hp_lead_pos1">were arrested at a DC airport</a> with one-way tickets out of the country and charged with campaign finance violations in connection with work in Ukraine. Which, you know, seems like something. Anyway, that brings us to now...
  todays: 
  - item: Former US Ambassador to Ukraine Maria Yovanovitch testified behind closed doors to House committees today. Yovanovitch--who was called "bad news" by the president on his July phone call with Ukrainian president Zelensky and who was named as a target by the associates of Rudy Giuliani who were arrested yesterday--testified that "she was forced to leave Kiev on 'the next plane' this spring" on the president's orders. Furthermore, "she warned that private influence and personal gain have usurped diplomats' judgment, threatening to undermine the nation’s interests and drive talented professionals out of public service." Which definitely doesn't seem optimal for, you know, diplomacy.

  - item: While Yovanovitch's testimony was not public, her opening statement for the deposition was leaked to multiple press outlets. In it, she warns that the State Department has been "attacked and hollowed out from within" and that "harm will come when private interests circumvent professional diplomats for their own gain, not the public good." It's worth reading the whole statement.

  - item: Yonanovitch's statement echoes reports from NBC last night that Fiona Hill, Trump's former top aide to Russia and Europe, is planning on testifying to Congress that "Rudy Giuliani and EU ambassador Gordon Sondland circumvented the National Security Council and the normal White House process to pursue a shadow policy on Ukraine."

  - item: Speaking of Gordon Sondland, who kicked off the week's excitement when he was blocked from testifying to the House by the president, his lawyers told NBC today that he will in fact testify next Thursday. However, texts and other documents requested won't accompany him because "by federal law and regulation, the State Department has sole authority to produce such documents." Yeah, don't place any bets on that happening.

  - item: And then there's Rudy Giuliani. We've learned a lot more today about his involvement with Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were arrested at Dulles Airport yesterday by federal authorities before they left the country. Specifically, it turns out that Giuliani was paid "hundreds of thousands of dollars" by Parnas for "business and legal advice" for Parnas's company--impossibly named "Fraud Guarantee"--at the same time that Parnas and Fruman were investigating in the Ukraine on Giuliani's behalf. Look, it's confusing. Parnas and Fruman have now been subpoenad by the House, maybe they can sort it out.

    url: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/us/politics/rudy-giuliani-ukraine-associates.html
  - item: It seems like this Giuliani-associates story is only going to get more confusing, as a third person named in the indictment along with with Parnas and Fruman, a Ukrainian-born businessman named Andrey Kukushkin, was arrested in San Francisco earlier today. A fourth person named, David Correia, is still at large. What even am I writing.

  - item: And finally, because of course the week was going to wrap up this way, Donald Trump was asked by reporters on his way to a rally tonight if Rudy Giuliani was still his lawyer. His response? "I don't know." Sure, let's go with that.

  yesterday: Week three of the impeachment inquiry, which started with a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/08/white-house-formally-tells-democrats-it-wont-cooperate-with-impeachment-probe-000279">series of provocations</a> by the White House, took a breather on Wednesday. Beyond a <a href="https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/10819-0">milquetoast letter</a> from Nancy Pelosi and some <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry-live-updates/2019/10/09/d1bb38e0-e9f7-11e9-9c6d-436a0df4f31d_story.html">words of warning</a> from former VP Joe Biden, it was an actual chill day. Which definitely didn't start a trend if you were wondering. 
  todays: 
  - item: Some days are like yesterday, where very little happened. And some days are like today where the morning starts with news that two associates of Rudy Giuliani were arrested at the airport with one-way tickets out of the country. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who on Monday refused to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry, were arrested by federal agents at Dulles Airport late Wednesday. Manhattan US Attorney Geoffrey Berman says the two "sought political influence not only to advance their own financial interests but to advance the political interests of at least one foreign official--a Ukrainian government official who sought the dismissal of the US ambassador to Ukraine." The two had lunch with Rudy Giuliani at Trump's Washington DC hotel earlier that day, because sure why not.

  - item: Parans and Fruman were the subject of a prescient BuzzFeed story back in July that outlined the work they were doing for Rudy Giuliani in Ukraine and is well worth a read-over in light of today's news. 
    source: BuzzFeed
    url: https://www.buzzfeednews.com/amphtml/mikesallah/rudy-giuliani-ukraine-trump-parnas-fruman?__twitter_impression=true
  - item: Before departing for a rally Thursday night in Minneapolis, Trump took questions on the White House lawn and, as you might expect, denied knowing Parans and Fruman. "I don't know them, I don't know about them, I don't know what they do," he yelled. "You'll have to ask Rudy, I just don't know." 
    source: Associated Press
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDb8vaDDijs
  - item: Meanwhile Democrats in the House subpoenad Energy Secretary Rick Perry for documents about his involvement with Trump and Ukraine. Cited in the subpoena is the Axios story from this weekend that reported Trump told House Republicans that he only called Ukraine in July at the urging of Rick Perry, so it's not like nobody saw this subpoena coming or anything. "Your failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena," reads the accompanying letter, "including at the direction or behest of the President or the White House, shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House's impeachment inquiry and may be used as an adverse inference against you and the President." But, you know, we'll see.

  - item: And finally, tomorrow brings ousted US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch to the House for a deposition. Yovanovitch is called "bad news" in the call Trump had with Ukrainian president Zelensky in July. After saying that she was removed as ambassador, Trump went on to say "she's going to go through some things." Maybe by "some things" he meant testifying to the House on an impeachment inquiry? Anyway, we'll see if she doesn't get blocked last minute like Tuesday's expected testimony by Ambassador Sondland.

  tomorrow: Well, certainly the question of whether or not Yovanovitch will show up tomorrow is question one. And I'd expect we hear more fully from Democrats about the White House's refusal to cooperate--though I've been waiting for that all week. After that, it's Friday, so expect it definitely to be just super duper chill. Knock off early.
- date: 2019-10-09
  yesterday: Week three of the impeachment inquiry blew up on Tuesday. The day opened with the White House <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/10/08/768200323/trump-administration-blocks-ambassadors-testimony-a-key-witness-in-ukraine-scand">blocking the testimony of ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland</a> and it ended <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/08/white-house-formally-tells-democrats-it-wont-cooperate-with-impeachment-probe-000279">with a letter from the White House</a> that accused the impeachment inquiry of being "illegitimate" and refused to comply with it. That's one way to end a Tuesday. 
  todays: 
  - item: The Democratic response to the White House's refusal to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry was surprisingly subdued today. Nancy Pelosi issued a mild statement that was short on both rhetoric and specifics. "Mr. President, you are not above the law," she wrote this morning. "You will be held accountable." However, the letter failed to explain what that accountability would be or when it would happen. 
    source: original document
    url: https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/10819-0
  - item: In fact, the strongest Democratic voice for impeachment today came not from the House but from Joe Biden. "President Trump has indicted himself by obstructing justice, refusing to comply with a congressional inquiry," he told reporters. "He’s already convicted himself.” Which would be nice if that's how it worked, but it actually isn't--someone has to convict him. 
    source: Washington Post
    url: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry-live-updates/2019/10/09/d1bb38e0-e9f7-11e9-9c6d-436a0df4f31d_story.html
  - item: The question Biden poses--whether Trump's refusal to comply with the inquiry is itself an impeachable offense that should be pursued--is apparently the source of an internal debate among House Democrats. While most seem to agree that the letter represents a clear case of obstruction of Congress, "Democrats say they prefer any obstruction charge to play a supporting, rather than starring, role in their efforts." Cool cool.
    source: Politico
    url: https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/09/trump-impeachment-obstruction-democrats-043564
  tomorrow: Today was quiet. Almost too quiet. Certainly there's a bigger shoe to drop on the White House's refusal to cooperate. For subpoenas to mean something they have to be enforcable. Today didn't see that enforcement happen--or even an idea of how Democrats would--will tomorrow?
- date: 2019-10-08
  yesterday: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/07/us/politics/trump-impeachment-ukraine.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage">Legal wranglings</a> have continued at pace with Trump's <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1181033360241709056">threats to "impeach" other lawmakers</a>. Really, that was Monday. It was a lot. This is the week that the impeachment proceedings really hit high gear and the best way to demonstrate that is not by looking back but looking forward...
  todays: 
  - item: Today feels like a series of escalating dares, culminating with a letter sent from the White House late this afternoon questioning the legitimacy of the entire impeachment inquiry and refusing to participate. "Given that your inquiry lacks any legitimate constitutional foundation, any pretense of fairness, or even the most elementary due process protections," writes White House lawyer Pat Cipollone, "the executive branch cannot be expected to participate in it." Which may not really be a thing, but as you can see from how the rest of the day played out below, it's the strategy they're going to go with. For now.

    url: https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/08/white-house-formally-tells-democrats-it-wont-cooperate-with-impeachment-probe-000279
  - item: This letter topped off a day of back-and-forths that centered around the sudden blocking of the testimony of the ambassardor the EU, Gordon Sondland, by (ostensibly) the State Department. "Ambassador Sondland had previously agreed to appear voluntarily today, without the need for a subpoena," wrote his lawyers, "in order to answer the Committee's questions on an expedited basis. As the sitting U.S. Ambassador to the EU and employee of the State Department, Ambassador Sondland is required to follow the Department's direction." OK, but...

    url: https://www.npr.org/2019/10/08/768200323/trump-administration-blocks-ambassadors-testimony-a-key-witness-in-ukraine-scand
  - item: Of course it didn't take long for Trump to take to Twitter and explain that he, in fact, blocked the testimony, rationalizing that Sondland "would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican's rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public." Sure, why not. Oh, also--keep "kangaroo court" in mind because we're going to circle back to that in a couple bullet points. 
    source: Twitter
    url: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1181560708808486914
  - item: As you might expect by this point, Trump's tweet and the blocked testimony took House Republicans by surprise and a contingent of House Republicans went to the White House not because they were upset that the executive branch had interfered in legislative branch biz, but to try and get on the same page. According to Bloomberg, "White House officials agreed to improve communication of their impeachment strategy with allies who are on the front lines." Don't make any bets. 
    source: Bloomberg
    url: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-08/house-republicans-ask-trump-to-fix-impeachment-coordination
  - item: The blocking of Sondland has lead Democrats to announce that they'll be subpoenaing him--remember that he featured prominently in the text messages House investigators released last week. The big question is what happens if he refuses to comply with a subpoena.

  - item: And finally, Trump's "kangaroo court" Tweet has already turned into a Republican talking point, with Reps Jim Jordan and Matt Gaetz accusing Democrats of running a "kangaroo court" and of Adam Schiff acting like--and reader I quote here--a "malicious Captain Kangaroo." I am so very tired. 
    source: Twitter
    url: https://twitter.com/bubbaprog/status/1181566493059891201
  tomorrow: Well, by every measure it seems like the long-promised "all hell breaks loose" is definitely on offer. But the main thing is it seems like it's very much up to the Democrats now for how they are going to proceed with enforcing subpoenas. 
- date: 2019-10-07
  yesterday: Welcome to week three of the impeachment inquiry, it's all going to go great right? Previously, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/controversial-phone-call-impeachment-calls-trump-whistleblower-timeline/story?id=65810201">a whistleblower report</a> of a phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky lead to House Democrats starting an impeachment inquiry. <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/documents/2019-10-04.EEC%20Engel%20Schiff%20to%20Mulvaney-WH%20re%20Subpoena.pdf">Legal wrangling</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/02/trump-says-democrats-wasting-time-on-bullshit-as-impeachment-probe-intensifies.html">name calling</a> followed (will let you guess who did what), <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/_cache/files/5/0/50759349-fe81-4444-a990-65c92528de82/50EE8A2F1CFC493A98876200762152FC.chairmen-letter-on-state-departmnent-texts-10-03-19.pdf">text messages</a> that backed up the basics of the inquiry were released, a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/2nd-whistleblower-forward-speaking-ig-attorney/story?id=66092396&cid=social_twitter_tw">second whistleblower stepped forward</a>, and well, here we are. 
  todays: 
  - item: More subpoenas went out from the House Intelligence Committee today, this time to the White House Budget office and the Pentagon. While previous subpoenas have been focused on Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Zelensky, these are focused on the motivations behind suspending $391 million in aid to Ukraine this summer--and whether the two are related. In other words, if this whole Ukrainian situation is a quid-pro-quo, today they're looking into the quid while previously they've been looking into the quo. Or maybe, I don't know--I don't speak Latin.

    url: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/07/us/politics/trump-impeachment-ukraine.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage
  - item: While subpoenas are going out and depositions are being scheduled, the House is also preparing for the testimony of the original whistleblower (a second was reported to have come forward this weekend). Concerned that their identity could be leaked by Republicans in traditional closed-door testimony, House Democrats are "considering testimony at a remote location and possibly obscuring the individual’s appearance and voice." Seems chill.

  - item: However, just because the House sends a request for testimony does not necessarily mean that person will show up. Today, two South Florida associates of Rudy Giuliani, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, announced through their lawyer (in a letter maddeningly set in Comic Sans) that they had "no response planned." According to the Miami Herald, "Democrats working on the burgeoning impeachment inquiry said Parnas and Fruman’s decision to ignore a request issued last Monday will lead to subpoenas, which would compel them to testify and provide documents or face criminal charges."
    source: Miami Herald
    url: https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article235876792.html
  - item: "And finally, while over the weekend Trump was threatening to impeach Mitt Romney (note: he can't), today he took to Twitter to say that Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff should be impeached for 'High Crimes and Misdemeanors, and even Treason' (note: he can't do that either). So things are going great."
    source: Twitter
    url: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1181033360241709056
  tomorrow: The second whistleblower certainly feels like the cloud hovering over this week for sure. Plus, there are a lot of subpoenas out there right now and we should soon see what the Democrats have planned for actually enforcing them. And also, it's Monday--we've got a whole lot of week left for things to go sideways.
- date: 2019-10-06
  yesterday: Week two of the impeachment inquiry was largely characterized by <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/documents/2019-10-04.EEC%20Engel%20Schiff%20to%20Mulvaney-WH%20re%20Subpoena.pdf">legal maneuvering</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/10/04/767205170/trump-demands-full-house-vote-on-impeachment-before-complying-with-lawmakers">dueling press statements</a> between House Democrats and the Trump administration. It came to a dramatic(ish) conclusion(ish) with the <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/_cache/files/5/0/50759349-fe81-4444-a990-65c92528de82/50EE8A2F1CFC493A98876200762152FC.chairmen-letter-on-state-departmnent-texts-10-03-19.pdf">release of text messages</a> between State Department officials that largely lined up with and fleshed out the original whistleblower's complaint that Trump was connecting military aide to Ukraine with investigating political rivals. That set up a weekend so chill that I completely upended my "no weekends" publishing plan. Welcome to Sunday. 
  todays: 
  - item: A second whistleblower has come forward! Reported Sunday morning by ABC News, this whistleblower, described only as an "intelligence official," has "first-hand knowledge of some of the allegations outlined in the original complaint." This second whistleblower has already spoken with Michael Atkinson, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community. First-hand knowledge would complicate the inaccurate Republican talking point that the first whistleblower was only reporting "hearsay."

  - item: Speaking of things that aren't hearsay, Republican Senator from Wisconsin Ron Johnson told the Wall Street Journal that the US Ambassador to the European Union explained to him back in August that US military aide to Ukraine was tied to investigating the 2016 election. "At that suggestion, I winced," Johnson told the Journal. "My reaction was, 'Oh, God. I don’t want to see those two things combined.'" Trump, naturally, denied that they were. But between the whistleblower, the State Department texts, Senator Johnson, and now a second whistleblower there's a lot of corroboration of this "hearsay."

  - item: Meanwhile Trump spent most of his Saturday at his Virginia golf club angry about Utah Senator Mitt Romney, who has offered some mild criticism of the Ukraine phone call and Trump's similar request for China to investigate Joe Biden. Trump seems to have decided that "I'm rubber, you're glue" is a workable defense and has called for Romney's impeachment. Please note, you can't actually impeach a US Senator.

  - item: And finally, because why not, yesterday it came out that Trump told House Republicans that this whole Ukrainian phone call mess was actually the work of former Texas Governor, Dancing with the Stars entrant, and current Energy Secretary Rick Perry. Which must come as a surprise to pretty much everyone involved since his name only appears in passing in the original whistleblower report, he's not mentioned on the call transcript, nor is he named in the released text messages. But hey, let's go with it. Conveniently, Rick Perry announced he was leaving his post as Energy Secretary last week.

  tomorrow: We're rolling up on a solid *checks notes* two weeks of this impeachment inquiry and we already have multiple confirmations of the central point of the investigation. So surely this next week will be very straightforward, right? Right? Hello?
- date: 2019-10-04
  yesterday: After a week of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/us/politics/impeachment-white-house-subpoena.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage">legal wrangling</a> by the Democrats and <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cnn-trump-bullshit-vulgarity_n_5d94dea1e4b0ac3cddb27d0e?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALXA_r29kaLfKOszR71iz8XBQhQluFvati-BG3gNQ5Bqve8H19kTTrOSBZ4zuJpKpj3bHKFg9mTPHYd5YLtyLi27XQjwojbFiSXicwsZOYovBWZtZhdDzujp9pq8nb8aMhgcAbHU17o7aA-U6m-I4naHA25XDthdcUSQmW3zN-AM">explosive statements</a> to the press by the president, yesterday ended with the <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/_cache/files/5/0/50759349-fe81-4444-a990-65c92528de82/50EE8A2F1CFC493A98876200762152FC.chairmen-letter-on-state-departmnent-texts-10-03-19.pdf">evening release of text messages</a> between various State Department officials that largely corroborated the whistleblower's original complaint that the president was withholding military aid from Ukraine in order to pressure them to investigate Joe Biden. It was quite a way to (almost) wrap the week. Which brings us to...
  todays: 
  - item: Low-key looming over today has been the end of the deadline set by Elijah Cummings, chair of the House Oversight Committee, for the White House to turn over documents related to the Ukrainian phone call or face a subpoena to do the same. Well, guess what? The White House didn't comply, and so just as this update was being drafted, a subpoena was sent to White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. The White House now has until October 18 to comply. "Your failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena," the accompanying letter reads, "including at the direction or behest of the President or others at the White House, shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House's impeachment inquiry and may be used as an adverse inference against you and the President."

  - item: According to a report by Axios, the White House is readying a response "arguing that President Trump and his team can ignore lawmakers' demands until [Pelosi] holds a full House vote formally approving an impeachment inquiry." Which doesn't seem to have a lot of legal standing, but here we are.

  - item: Meanwhile, if you've been wondering whatever happened to Vice President Pence, who seems to have gone missing, last night the Washington Post broke a story that Trump "repeatedly involved Vice President Pence in efforts to exert pressure on the leader of Ukraine at a time when the president was using other channels to solicit information that he hoped would be damaging to a Democratic rival." Sources close to Pence say he was "unaware" of Trump's motivations to get information on Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Which, OK sure.

  - item: And, citing in part the Washington Post's report, today House investigators sent a letter to the Vice President requesting a sprawling list of documents related to actions involving Ukraine. It's not a subpoena, yet, but Pence's deadline is October 15.

  tomorrow: It's the weekend, surely nothing will happen, right? But next week, expect extensive fireworks surrounding these latest subpoenas and document requests. This weekend though, let's all just hit the sauna or something.
- date: 2019-10-03
  yesterday: This week's impeachment news has been largely defined by <a href="ttps://www.cnn.com/2019/09/27/politics/pompeo-congressional-subpoena-ukraine/index.html">legal wrangling</a> and issuing statements to the press by both <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cnn-trump-bullshit-vulgarity_n_5d94dea1e4b0ac3cddb27d0e?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALXA_r29kaLfKOszR71iz8XBQhQluFvati-BG3gNQ5Bqve8H19kTTrOSBZ4zuJpKpj3bHKFg9mTPHYd5YLtyLi27XQjwojbFiSXicwsZOYovBWZtZhdDzujp9pq8nb8aMhgcAbHU17o7aA-U6m-I4naHA25XDthdcUSQmW3zN-AM">the President</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fooling-house-democrat-leading-impeachment-probe/story?id=66004383">the Democrats</a>. The presidents statements have been <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/02/politics/president-donald-trump-impeachment-democrats-pompeo/index.html">far more inflamatory</a>, and the Democrats have been firing back with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/us/politics/impeachment-white-house-subpoena.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage">legal threats</a>. It's been a long week. 
  todays:
  - item: LATE UPDATE—Late Thursday night, the three chairs of the House Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs committees released a series of texts they obtained from former US Special Envoy to the Ukraine Kurt Volker. In the letter that accompanies the release they write that these texts reflect concerns that "critical military assistance and the meeting between the two presidents were being withheld in order to place additional pressure on Ukraine to deliver on the President's demand for Ukraine to launch politically motivated investigations." They are truly wild and include conversations between State Department officials that largely corroborate and add further context to the whistleblower's report. As Bill Taylor, the Charge d'Affaires (the acting ambassador, essentially) at the US Embassy in Ukraine asks in one of the texts, "Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?" Yes, yes we are.

  - item: Some days you try hard to come up with a lead story and some days Donald Trump stands on the White House lawn and asks Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. And then ask China to do it too.  Ukraine "should investigate the Bidens," he said to reporters on live TV, "because how does a company that's newly formed—and all these companies—and by the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine." This really happened.

  - item: Meanwhile, the Democrat's impeachment inquiry that centers on whether Trump asked the Ukraine to investigate a political rival continued, despite the fact that he did so live on television moments before. Today saw former US Special Envoy to the Ukraine Kurt Volker testify that he "warned President Trump’s personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, that Giuliani was receiving untrustworthy information from Ukrainian political figures about former vice president Joe Biden and his son." Volker resigned his position last week after being implicated in the whistleblower report.

  - item: Speaking of Volker, the Guardian has an excellent look into how this "mild-mannered former ambassador to Nato" ended up enmeshed in this whole fiaso. The short of it? "He really tried to have his cake and eat it, thinking he could operate inside the administration with one foot outside, that would give him some flexibility. But those two things were incompatible."

  - item: And finally, because today wasn't absurd enough, '90s powergrunge band/internet meme Nickelback issued a copyright infringement notice against a tweet from the president that used the band's video for the song "Photograph" to implicate Joe Biden and his son Hunter in dealings with the Ukrainians. Writing this sentence made me very tired.

  tomorrow: Tomorrow is Elijah Cummings deadline for White House cooperation to turn over documents or he's subpoenaing them, so that should be interesting. Also, it's Friday tomorrow, I'm sure it will be chill. TGIF right? 
- date: 2019-10-02
  yesterday: The second week of the impeachment inquiry has moved rapidly into a legal maneuvering stage, with Democrats issuing subpoenas to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/27/politics/pompeo-congressional-subpoena-ukraine/index.html">Secretary of State Mike Pompeo</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/us/politics/impeach-giuliani-subpoena.html">Rudy Giuliani</a> and those same folks <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/01/mike-pompeo-trump-impeachment-inquiry-democrats-ukraine">pushing back</a> against complying. Tensions, already high, are getting higher, with the president repeatedly calling the impeachment inquiry <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1178643854737772545">treasonous</a>. It's been a week, and it's only Wednesday.
  todays: 
  - item: Wednesday opened with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo telling reporters traveling with him in Rome that he was listening in on the call between Trump and Ukrainian president Zelensky--he had not previously revealed his presence on the call. "Asked if the call raised any red flags in his mind, Pompeo did not respond."

    url: https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-10-02/pompeo-ukraine-call-between-trump-and-zelensky?_amp=true&__twitter_impression=true
  - item: Later in the morning, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi held her weekly press conference where she was joined by Chair of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff. At the presser, Schiff said that if the President or the administration interferes in the impeachment inquiry, "any action like that that forces us to litigate or have to consider litigation will be considered further evidence of obstruction of justice."

    url: https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fooling-house-democrat-leading-impeachment-probe/story?id=66004383
  - item: Meanwhile, Chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee Elijah Cummings issued a letter stating that if the White House did not voluntarily produce documents related to Trump's Ukraine call by Friday, he would subpoena them. "I do not take this step lightly," he wrote.

    url: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/us/politics/impeachment-white-house-subpoena.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage
  - item: Then Trump held a wild press conference with the president of Finland where he once again called for Schiff to be "looked into for treason" and claimed that Schiff wrote the whistleblower report himself. And then it <i>really</i> went off the rails, ending with Trump screaming at Fox News reporter John Roberts to ask a question to the Finnish president instead of continually pressing him about the Ukraine call.
    source: CNN
    url: https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/02/politics/president-donald-trump-impeachment-democrats-pompeo/index.html
  - item: Finally, the New York Times offered a revealing look at the early days of the whistleblower complaint, including the detail that the whistleblower, following correct procedure, approached an aide at the House Intelligence Committee about their complaint after they felt it wasn't moving forward at the CIA. "The House staff member, following the committee’s procedures, suggested the officer find a lawyer to advise him and meet with an inspector general, with whom he could file a whistle-blower complaint." This is already being mischaracterized by the president as direct involvement by Schiff in the complaint.

  tomorrow: At this point it definitely feels like "all hell breaks loose" is an option, but beyond that, former US Special Envoy to the Ukraine Kurt Volker is scheduled to testify in the House tomorrow, and then there's the Friday deadline on Rep. Cummings threat to subpoena the White House.
- date: 2019-10-01

Subpoenas have gone out to both <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-issue-subpoena-pompeos-ukraine-documents/story?id=65912440">Secretary of State Mike Pompeo</a> and the president's <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-issue-subpoena-pompeos-ukraine-documents/story?id=65912440">personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani</a>, who seems to be at the center of much of the Ukraine intrigue. 
  todays: 
  - item: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took to Twitter this morning to say that the Democrats were attempting to "intimidate, bully, & treat improperly the distinguished professionals of the Department of State" by asking for five current and former officials to testify. Democrats responded by saying that "any effort to intimidate witnesses or prevent them from talking with Congress--including state department employees--is illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry."
